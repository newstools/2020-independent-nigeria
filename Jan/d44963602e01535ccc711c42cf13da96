ABAKALIKI – The Ebonyi State Independent Electoral Commission (EBSIEC) has fixed the state’s local government council elections for Saturday, April 25, 2020. Recall that the last local government council elections for chairmen and the ward councilors were held in April 2017 and the winners were sworn-in on May 29, 2017. To this effect, the tenures of the council chairmen and the ward councilors will expire on May 29, 2020. But the tenures of council chairmen and the ward councilors have been reduced to two years, following recent amendment to the state’s electoral law. This was contained in a statement signed by the EBSIEC chairman in the state, Jossy Eze, and the Secretary, Chukwuemeka Oji, which was obtained by the Daily Independent on Wednesday. “Pursuant to the provision of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), the Ebonyi State Independent Electoral Commission Law, 2001, as amended, the Ebonyi State Electoral related matters, No.001 of 2017, as amended, and all other powers enabling her in that behalf, Ebonyi State Independent Electoral Commission do hereby public and give notice of local government council elections in Ebonyi State, 2020. “Further take note that the date of election [day of polls] is Saturday, April 25, 2020, throughout Ebonyi State; and the nomination papers are to be delivered at the Commission’s Headquarters, No. 1Onwe road, Ebonyi State.” “Also take notice that it is published in each of the thirteen local government areas and the one thousand seven hundred and eighty five (1785) electoral wards in Ebonyi State that elections are to be held”, the statement read.
