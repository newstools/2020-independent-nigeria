LAGOS – The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has been advised to ensure that Coach Gernot Rohr is retained as the Super Eagles manager. This advice was given by Coach Zachary Baraje, one of the veteran managers in the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL), in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT. Baraje noted that if Nigerians want the Super Eagles to easily qualify for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon and also for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, there was the need to retain him. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Baraje highlighted that the impact of the coach on the development of the Super Eagles could not be overemphasised, affirming that his understanding of the team would be handy in their bid to qualify for the two tournaments. “As it is now, the coach is important to Nigeria, particularly in the qualifiers for the 2021 African Cup of Nations and also the 2020 World Cup. “If we must say it the way it is, it has been a long time since a coach made an impact Rohr has made on Super Eagles. “Rohr has discovered a lot of players for the team and he has made the players play as a team, bringing in harmony in the dressing room. “If for any reason a new coach is brought in, certainly Nigeria will struggle because the person will take time to adjust to the current rhythm of the team and that will not be well for us. “But I think NFF should draw the line to make sure they have adequate check in case of excesses from him, but generally, they should do everything to retain the coach,” he said. Meanwhile, the NFF has presented a fresh contract to Rohr with stringent terms which included the coach permanently living in Nigerian and only travelling once in three months. Also, his lists for matches must be vete by the Technical Department of the football house, among other conditions.
