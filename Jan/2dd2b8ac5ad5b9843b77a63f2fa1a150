Birnin Kebbi – An environmentalist and senior lecturer in the Federal University Birnin Kebbi (FUBK), Dr. Zuni Aminu, has blamed the lack of education for the vicious circle of poverty among women. Aminu, who is an activist for women’s development, disclosed this in an interview with Daily Independent correspondent in Birnin Kebbi on Wednesday. She said that the lack of education has continued to limit career options and job opportunities for women and keeps the female gender in a vicious circle of poverty in the country. According to her, the lack of access to education of women remains a major challenge in many societies, adding that gender mainstreaming can actually help to tackle this. She explained that the cultural preference of the male child often contributes to denying females access to quality education, especially in poor homes where conscious decisions are taken to advance the male-child at the detriment of the girl-child of that family. The woman activist further said that while girls are domesticated, boys are sent to school. “Thus, the female child has limited opportunities of education and building a carrier for herself and quite naturally, is sent into early marriage and child-bearing.” Aminu called on women to partner with men to engage more actively in nation-building at its highest level in the country, saying that women now play active roles in politics and governance and deserve more political appointments. She urged government at all levels to include women and girls in the developmental process of the country as part of gender mainstreaming.
