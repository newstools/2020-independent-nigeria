A gunman who forced a police officer’s head underwater during an escape bid has been jailed. Calvert Batchelor, 37, attacked PC Paul Newman after being cornered by officers near a brook (small stream) when he fled a traffic stop in Walsall on July 17 last year. When he realized he’d run into a dead-end he lunged at the policeman, gouging his eyes and grabbing his mouth so hard he punctured a hole under the officer’s tongue, West Midlands Police said. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network During the struggle both men fell in the brook where the veteran traffic officer’s head was forced underwater, leaving him fearing for his life. Batchelor was eventually hand-cuffed on the banks of the body of water by PC Newman and a colleague. Police searched his car and in the driver’s side pocket found a loaded Glock-style blank-firing pistol, illegally converted to fire potentially lethal live ammunition. Batchelor, of Newtown, Birmingham, admitted possession of a gun and ammunition and wounding at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Tuesday. He was jailed for nine years and four months. PC Newman, an officer with 20 years on the force, has still not returned to police. Chief Inspector Rachel Joyce, of the Central Motorway Police Group, said: “This was a grotesque, violent attack on a brave police officer. “PC Newman suffered nasty facial injuries and is still managing the long-term psychological impact of being involved in such a traumatic incident. “Attacks like this are totally unacceptable and we will always push for the toughest possible penalty against anyone who abuses our staff. “I’m glad the courts have recognized the severity of this incident and handed Batchelor a long jail term. “We all wish Paul the very best in his continued recovery and hope to welcome him back to the police family when he is ready.”
