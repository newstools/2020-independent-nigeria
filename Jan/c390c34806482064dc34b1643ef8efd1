That’s led to numerous rumours linking Arsenal with players from the country, and it’s felt like there’s been some truth to a good number of them. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Not only will agents be trying to sell players to Arsenal thanks to their Brazilian technical director, but he also has great connections in the country given his playing career and role with the national team. Globo Esporte say Arsenal have made a proposal to sign Pablo Mari from Flamengo. The Premier League club are in negotiations to sign the defender, and Globo feel there’s a ‘good chance’ of a deal being done.
