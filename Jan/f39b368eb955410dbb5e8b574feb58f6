XAVIER NDAH, TITILOPE JOSEPH LAGOS – Operatives of the Lagos State Police Command have arrested 33 females suspected to be sex workers in Ijora Badia area of the state. The ladies who were paraded at the command’s headquarters in Ikeja Wednesday by the Commissioner of Police (CP), Hakeem Odumosu, were nabbed on January 7, 2020 at odd hours of the night, it was learnt. Speaking on the arrest, the command said they were arrested as part of the operation launched against social miscreants and were still being profiled and after investigations those found guilty would be charged to court while others with no case to answer would be allowed to go home. “At the end of the day, the police will be able to say conclusively, those who are going to be charged to court and those who will be released,” Odumosu explained. However, some of the ladies refuted the police claim, saying they were picked in their various homes. One of the suspects who identified herself as Helen Michael said she was arrested at about 12 p.m. in Ijora where she was selling hot drinks (Paraga). Helen, a widow and mother of two, said she did not know her offence as she was picked by the police at that hour. Another lady, Rose, who said she is a mother of a two months old baby, has not been able to contact her family since her arrest. Also, one Mariam Ismaila who also denied being a prostitute as alleged, said that she was also arrested in her house. Meanwhile, the command’s spokesperson, Bala Elkana, has said that the ladies were all saying what they said to create sentiments because they don’t want to go through the legal process. “If you look at some of them, you will know better,” he said.
