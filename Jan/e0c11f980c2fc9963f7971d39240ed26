Video footage has emerged showing the dying moments of a female cartel boss after she was fatally wounded during a shootout with police in Mexico. The clip and photographs appear to confirm she was María Guadalupe López Esquivel, known as ‘La Catrina,’ a female member of a cartel hit squad that massacred 13 police officers in October. The 21-year-old was involved in an attack against the military, national guard and police in La Bocanda, a town in the central state of Michoacán, The Daily Mail reports. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Officials in Michoacán said six male gunmen were captured and a woman was killed after they opened fire on soldiers and police in the same area where the October ambush occurred. State officials initially did not provide the identity of the woman killed in the Friday shootout, but videos and photos posted on the internet late Sunday showed the woman wounded on a stretcher, with a tattoo of a ‘Catrina’ on her thigh. Photos of the woman circulated earlier showed the same tattoo in the same place; some photos also show her holding a pistol. The Catrina is a skeletal female figure with a wide hat that has become associated with Mexico’s Day of the Dead. Graphic footage of her final moments uploaded by 3W  below:
