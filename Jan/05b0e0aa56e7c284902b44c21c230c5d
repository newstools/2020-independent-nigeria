The
Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) mem­bers will remain
united in their stewardship of the oil market, whether or not their current pro­duction
cuts are extended beyond their currently scheduled March expiry, OPEC Secretary
General Mohammed Barkindo, has said. Russian energy minister Alex­ander
Novak has suggested that his country may seek to exit the production cuts, but
Barkindo said the charter of cooperation between the 24-member OPEC coalitions
is about more than just supply adjust­ments. The agreement calls on the mem­bers
to regularly consult on the oil market, but does not commit any party to
specific production caps. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “The bond between participat­ing
countries has become very strong, including, of course, per­sonal friendships
across capitals and nations,” he said on the side­lines of the International
Petro­leum Technology Conference in Saudi Arabia. “This partnership has come to stay for the good of OPEC and
non-OPEC [producers], as well as consuming countries and the glob­al economy.” OPEC, Russia and nine other countries are entering their fourth
year of production cuts aimed at supporting oil prices, with the current deal
that went into force January 1 calling on the coalition to slash 1.7 million
b/d of output through March. Saudi Arabia has also pledged to cut a further
400,000 b/d if all other members respect their production quotas. The alliance
will meet again March 5-6 in Vienna to decide on the future of the deal.
