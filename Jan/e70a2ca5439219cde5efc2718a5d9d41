A couple, Ahgwekure and Brevery Solomon, on Friday, appeared in a  Life Camp Magistrates’ Court for allegedly assaulting their landlady, who did not refund their money. The police charged the couple, who live in Pinatech Estate, Life Camp Abuja with assault. The Prosecution Counsel, ASP Peter Ejike, told the court that the complainant, Mary Michael,  reported the matter at the Life Camp Police Station on Jan. 7. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Ejike alleged that on Jan. 6, the defendants went to the complainants’ house and assaulted her over non-refund of rent paid into the complainant’s bank account by the defendants. He alleged that the defendants injured the complainant. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of  Section 265 of the Penal Code. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the offence. Magistrate Sharon Tanko admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N200, 000 each with one surety each. Tanko ordered that the sureties must be reliable and must deposit his or her identity card at the court registry for verification. She also ordered that the sureties must be resident within the jurisdiction of the court and his or her address must be verified by the court officer. Tanko adjourned the case until March 11, for hearing.
