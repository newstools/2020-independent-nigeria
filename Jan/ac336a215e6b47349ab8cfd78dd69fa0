LAGOS – Former President Goodluck Jonathan has received members of the executive of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), who paid him a courtesy visit over the December attack at his Otueke residence, where a soldier was killed by gunmen. In a press statement made available to journalists on Wednesday by media aide to the former president, Ikechukwu Eze, he maintained that the soldier would have remained alive if not for the job he was doing in his home. While addressing the students, Jonathan said their coming to sympathise with him, over the attack was highly appreciated, stressing that the fact that a soldier lost his life in that attack traumatised him. He said that the young man wouldn’t have died, the way he did, if he was not protecting him.

Whenever I consider that people could do that to a former President who has reasonable security guarding him, my mind reaches out to the rest of Nigerians who do not have that level of protection. I am worried that so many people are becoming victims of sporadic shootings, kidnappings and so on. I believe that the country will get over the kind of insecurity it currently faces,” he said. The former president highlighted the importance of education and urged the students to be serious with their studies, adding that it was only when people are educated that the country would be able to manage governance and development issues better. He urged the young people to believe in themselves and believe in their country, pointing out that they would surely get to their destination. While speaking earlier, the NANS President, Danielson Akpan, said that the leadership of the umbrella student body had come to sympathise with him over the attack in his house and to thank him for his legacies in the education sector.
