YENAGOA â€“ A group, Patriotism Advancement and Community Orientation Network, has filed a suit at the Bayelsa State High Court against the Ogbia Local Government Council for refusing to give account of its stewardship. Listed as defendants/respondents in the Suit Number OHC/19/2019, is the chairman of the Ogbia LGA, Ebinyo Turner, and other officials of the council. PACON, a non-governmental organisation, relied on the Freedom of Information Act, 2011 to sue the LGA, where former President Goodluck Jonathan hailed from. Before filing of the suit, the group had on December 9 written to the council demanding full disclosure of some of its transactions, including revenue that accrued to the council. PACON, in the letter signed by its Arch Convener, Ebikebuna Aluzu, addressed to the Ogbia council chairman, said its request was in line with relevant sections of the FOI Act, including Sections 1, 4 and 31. It specifically requested the council to provide certified true copies of transactions relating to Ogbia LGA. It also demanded proof of the total allocation received from January 1, 2019 to November 30, 2019 as well as receipts from the Joint Account Allocation Committee within the period under review and Financial Statement of Account from January 2019 to November 15, 2019. The NGO, therefore, asked the court to make a declaration that by the interpretation and construction of Section 31 of the FOI Act, the first defendant/respondent is a public institution within the meaning of the Act. It argued that refusal of the council to make the information available amounted to a breach of the law.
