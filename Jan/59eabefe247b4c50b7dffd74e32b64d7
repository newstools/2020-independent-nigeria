Burger King has launched its first plant-based burger in the UK – but it is not suitable for vegans and vegetarians. The soy-based version of its Whopper burger is cooked on the same grill as meat burgers. The fast food chain says the Rebel Whopper is aimed at those who want to cut meat consumption. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network But a spokesperson for the Vegan Society called the launch a “missed opportunity”. Burger King says that the burger “patty” itself is plant-based, but because of how it is cooked it will not be labelled as suitable for vegans or vegetarians. It will also be served with mayonnaise unless the customer asks otherwise. Katie Evans, marketing director for the chain, said the burger was aimed at “flexitarians”. She added it wanted the burger to replicate the “flame-grilled taste” as closely as possible. Burger King did confirm, though, that its vegetarian bean burger and its vegetarian option on the children’s menu are cooked separately. Sam Calvert, head of communications at the Vegan Society, said that not making the new burger fully vegan “seems a missed opportunity”. She added that vegan mayonnaise was “readily available” and used by other well-known chains, which would also make the burger suitable for some religious groups that avoid eating certain animals and eggs. Lifestyle blogger Donna Wishart criticised Burger King for failing to deliver “actual vegan products” when other fast food companies do so.
