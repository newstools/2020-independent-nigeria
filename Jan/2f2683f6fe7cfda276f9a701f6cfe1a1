Headliners Shane Lowry and Tony Finau started slowly at the Hong Kong Open on Thursday, with former cham­pion Wade Ormsby setting the early pace as the tournament teed off six weeks after being postponed amid pro-democra­cy protests. Ormsby birdied three of the first five holes – and added three more against a lone bo­gey – to end with a five-under 65, hailing the “good vibes” at the historic Fanling course European Tour title in 2017. Japan’s Tomoharu Otsu­ki was also five under, while South Korea’s Yikeun Chang and Australians Travis Smyth and David Gleeson were one behind and joint second. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The tight fairways and breezy conditions challenged, with Open winner Lowry fin­ishing at one under. “It was very, very tricky… anything in the 60s out there is pretty good,” the Irishman said on his first return to the course in a decade. “I think I can build on that going forward.” US big hitter Tony Finau was also subdued, finishing at one under but needing a spectacular save for par on the ninth after two misplaced shots. “Tomorrow (today) I’ve got to hit a little bit better,” he said, admitting there was a little bit of “rust” remain­ing from a break taken after the President’s Cup in Mel­bourne.”
