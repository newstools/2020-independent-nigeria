The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema, has underscored the need for massive investment in Nigeria’s agricultural sector to achieve the Federal Government’s diversification goal. Onyema, who gave the advice in a chat with select journalists in Abuja, said it was high time the country started looking at agriculture as the anchor of the economy as against oil currently the mainstay, which would be exhausted one day. He said: “The earlier we start looking the way of agriculture, the best for us; we are blessed with massive land in the north and that is hope of this country in future.
