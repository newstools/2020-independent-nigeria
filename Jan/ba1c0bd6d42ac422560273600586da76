ABUJA – Attorney General of the Fed­eration and Minister of Jus­tice, Abubakar Malami SAN, on Tuesday commissioned the first national e-depository of treaties at the Federal Minis­try of Justice. Malami said the National Depository of Treaties would serve as the depository of all treaties entered into between the government of the feder­ation and any other country of any Ministry, Agency or Department in line with Sec­tion 4 of the Treaties (Making Procedure, etc.) Act Cap. T20 Laws of the Federation (LFN) 2004. Therefore, the AGF reiterat­ed the need for all Ministries, Departments and Agencies to transmit to the National De­pository of Treaties domiciled in Federal Ministry of Justice all executed agreements, mem­oranda of understanding, and treaties in their custody and those to be entered in the fu­ture in their original form.

He said the project was geared towards achieving functional National Depos­itory of Treaties, maintain a comprehensive/updated register of treaties as well as ensure that all treaties, agree­ment and protocols entered into by the government were preserved.
