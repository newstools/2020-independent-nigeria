The Kano State chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Rabiu Sulaiman Bichi, has reportedly defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). According to Daily Nigerian, a source close to the party chairman said his decision to dump the party was based on principles and personal conviction. “The decision of Rabiu Sulaiman Bichi was not related to the outcome of the Supreme Court judgement. It was purely based on principles and personal conviction. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “In the affairs of Kwankwasiyya, Rabiu Bichi has been lately rendered irrelevant, ostracised and sidelined from the decision-making of the Kwankwasiyya movement. Despite his commitment to the cause, he was looked down upon as a saboteur,” he added. Bichi’s alleged defection is coming few days after the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and cross-appeal instituted by Alhaji Abba Kabiru Yusuf, the gubernatorial candidate of PDP while affirming Governor Ganduje’s election. Delivering judgment, Justice Sylvester Ngwuta declared that the grounds of the two appeals brought by the appellant were dismissed for lack of merit. He added that the grounds of the appeals were blanket in law, unproved and could not accommodate all infractions of the electoral process.
