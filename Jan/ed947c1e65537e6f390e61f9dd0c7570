OSOGBO – A former Presidential candidate of National Action Council (NAC), Dr. Olapade Agoro, has chastised those clamouring for retention of power in the North after the present administration, describing it reckless and capable of inciting violence in the country.

In a statement titled: “Nigeria Threading The Dangerous Road To Self-Annihilation—A Warning”, issued, copy of which was made available to Daily Independent, Agoro said that those clamouring for power to retain in the North have refused to learn from history that Nigeria is one nation though of diverse tribes and languages. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Agoro noted that it was untenable and irresponsibility of those clamouring for retention of power in the North, adding that it could be seen as hate speech that could lead to violence. He explained that the resolution by the National Assembly to rehabilitate the complex withN37b was an unpatriotic, unreasonable and day light robbery attempt to rub the country of a large fortune at a time of Nigeria’s economic instability. According to him, “Drastic efforts must be found to putting an end to the making of the National Assembly home to members’ reckless, irresponsible, wicked and reckless earnings beyond the average means of the nation. “Members of the National Assembly are ordinary Nigerians and must not be allowed constituting themselves menace on resources of the nation. “Taking into cognizance the fact that the National Assembly Complex was in year 1999 built at cost of US$35.18 million with the exchange rate as at year 1999 being Naira 21 to 1 US$ translating to 35 X 21 = N770 million Naira in 1999, it behooves that to suggest that that to now RENOVATE at cost of 37 billion Naira that parliamentary complex built in 1999 at total cost of 777 million Naira will be nothing but evil and the devils wicked plan to hold the nation down to dormancy.”
