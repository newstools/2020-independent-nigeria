The chief executive of one of Pakistan’s most influential newspapers has denied the accusation he raped an acclaimed filmmaker, in a case that has spotlighted sexual abuse targeting men and added momentum to the country’s fledgling #MeToo movement. Director Jamshed Mahmood Raza took to social media over the weekend to allege that Dawn newspaper’s Hameed Haroon raped him 13 years ago. In October, Raza first described the assault publicly on Twitter but referred to the alleged perpetrator as a “powerful person in our media world”. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Haroon – who hails from one of Pakistan’s wealthiest and most influential families – issued a fierce denial in Dawn, the country’s most popular English newspaper, late on Monday, calling the accusations “simply untrue and intentionally fabricated”. “I categorically deny the allegation of rape leveled against me,” said Haroon in a statement. Raza later slammed Haroon’s comments, saying the statement was “nothing but a slap to all us survivors”. The allegations have again stirred controversy in the deeply conservative country, where most discussions about sex and abuse are considered taboo. Some voices have called for accountability, while others dismissed notions of male-on-male sexual assault. “I have a question: how can a grown man be raped by another individual? Couldn’t they have fought him off,” tweeted writer Salman Rashid.
