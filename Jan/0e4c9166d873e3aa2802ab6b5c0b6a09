P/HARCOURT – The Rivers state Police Command on Saturday doused the tension generated by some residents of the Eliozu community following the outbreak of fire incident that engulfed the government owned scrap center in the Obio/Akpo local government area of the state. The command spokesman, DSP Nnamdi Omoni, who confirmed the incident, said there was no need to panic as the fire had since been put off. He said: “I can assure you that there was no casualty when the incident occurred and there is also no need for people to panic.” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Scrap Yard at Eliozu is a centre for the dumping of condemned tires, which were swept off the streets by the newly established Governor Nyesom Wike’s task force against street trading and illegal parks in the state. It is located opposite the popular Eliozu Market, off the East-West and G.U. Ake Road. Witnesses said the fire fighters, who arrived the scene with two fire trucks from the state’s fire Service, were said to be helpless as they complained that they couldn’t get access to the fire. Responding to the incident, the state Commissioner for Special Duties, Dr Bariere Thomas, said the ministry was aware of the fire and was doing something to put it out. He also cautioned residents of Port Harcourt to be careful while handling inflammable materials during this harmattan season.
