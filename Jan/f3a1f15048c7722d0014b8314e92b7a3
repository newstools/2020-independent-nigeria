The Coordinator of Ohoazara East Development Centre in Ohazara LGA of Ebonyi State, Mrs. Martha Nwankwo, has constituted a vigilance group to checkmate the activities of herdsmen in the area. This followed an incident last week in which an alleged Fulani herdsman identified as Laulo Isa raped to death a-54-old woman, Mary Okereke in Ugwulangwu, a community in the area. The suspect has since been arrested by the Police. “On December 28, 2019, at about 8 p.m., one Laulo Isa, a herdsman aged 20 years, accosted and waylaid one 54-year-old Mary Okereke. There was a struggle between the two of them, but he overpowered the woman and had canal knowledge of her. Unfortunately during the struggle, the woman lost her life,” the police report revealed. The vigilance group was inaugurated at an enlarged security meeting convened by the Coordinator at the weekend to ensure that security was beefed up in the community to forestall future occurrence. The representative of the Governor and Special Assistant on Vocational Education, Barr. Adaeze P. Nwaji, while inaugurating the group said the administration of Governor David Umahi was wholly committed to the security of lives and property of the people of the state. She assured that Ebonyi State Government would continue to ensure that peace and security of lives and property of the citizenry were sustained. “Our governor places high premium on the safety of lives and property of Ebonyi people. You can recall vividly how His Excellency swiftly swung into action when one of our brothers was gruesomely murdered in South Africa. “His Excellency, the Governor, Engr. Dr. David Nweze Umahi and the Executive Chairman of Ohaozara Local Government Area, Hon. Princess Nkechinyere Iyioku, would have loved to be present here but they delegated me to represent them even as they are already  dealing with the matter at the state level,” she said.
