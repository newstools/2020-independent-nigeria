XAVIER NDAH, RAJI
ADEBAYO Justice
Oladiran Akintola of Oyo State High Court, on Thursday, January 30, 2020, or­dered
that two travel agents, Semiu Oluwole Ololade and Adegboyega Adefuye, be
remanded in the custody of Nigeria Correctional Service Center, Agodi, Ibadan,
till Feb­ruary 4, 2020, when the bail applications filed on their be­half
following an alleged visa fraud would be determined. The
Economic and Fi­nancial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ibadan Zonal Office, arraigned
the two, along with their companies, Frenage Travel & Tour Limited and
Protective Services Nigeria Limited, respectively, on a 53-count charge,
bordering on obtaining money by false pretence and allegedly de­frauding
several Nigerians to the tune of N15 million. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The
petitioners alleged that Ololade and Adefuye conspired to come up with a scam
in which they claimed to have the where­withal to help people secure travel
visa to Dubai and Canada, and also get them work permit on arrival. The
fraud which was pro­moted on electronic media attracted many Nigerians who were
desperate to seek greener pasture abroad, with every applicant, required to pay
N300,000, in order to par­take. However,
after fulfilling their side of the bargain, the petitioners alleged that they
later found out that the accused only used the bait to extort them. The
defendants pleaded not guilty to all the charges, prompting the prosecution
counsel, Babatunde Sonoiki, to ask the court for a date for commencement of
trial and for them to be remanded in the custody of Nigeria Correc­tional
Service (NCS), which Justice Akintola granted and adjourned to February 4,
2020, for arguments on the bail ap­plications.
