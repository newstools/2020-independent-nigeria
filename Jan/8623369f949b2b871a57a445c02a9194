Jos – Traditional rulers from Mangu, Barkin Ladi, Bokkos, and Riyom, including Fulani leaders from the local government areas of Plateau State, were on Thursday evening whisked off to Abuja for thorough interrogation by the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, over the recent crisis that engulfed their communities, leading to the death of over 30 persons. The arrest came less than 24 hours after Plateau State governor, Simon Bako Lalong, ordered the state Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyede, to go after them following killings and destruction of property around Kwatas and nearby communities of Bokkos LGA. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Ubah Gabriel, confirmed the development and said: “For every Ardo that was moved to Abuja, an equivalent of the community leaders from that area were equally picked and taken to Abuja for interrogations.” When Daily Independent visited the Jos Police Command Headquarters on Thursday, lawyers representing various arrested traditional rulers and Fulani Ardos were seen making frantic efforts to bail their clients before the order from the office of the Inspector-General came that they should all be whisked to Abuja for further interrogation concerning the crisis and those behind it.
