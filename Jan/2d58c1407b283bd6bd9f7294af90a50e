ILORIN – If Kwara State was unable to offset its N7 billion Universal Basic Education (UBEC) counterpart funding, its education sector may continue to suffer dilapidation like the 31 schools the state government plans to renovate soon. This is according to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara, who revealed this on Thursday. The governor made this disclosure at the flag-off of reconstruction of 31 dilapidated schools across the state, where he also used the occasion to flag off the distribution of exercise books to all public schools in the state. AbdulRazaq said the state has paid the counterpart fund to the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) to enable it access UBEC funds to renovate and reconstruct public schools. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He said the state has not been able to access UBEC fund because the contracts awarded since 2013 have not been completed. “We are trying to meet up with the plan because what is delaying us is that the contracts that were awarded in 2013 need to be concluded and certified before we have full access to the fund. “Hopefully, this year we will commence accessing the funds to improve our public schools,” he said. The governor said that the state’s accumulated fund in UBEC was over N7 billion, adding that the future of education in the state was bright with the N7 billion pending. “We want to restore education in Kwara back to number one in Northern Nigeria,” AbdulRazaq AbdulRazaq said over 100 public schools across the state were in dire need of reconstruction, adding that the government was starting with 31 schools.
