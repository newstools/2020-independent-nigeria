India has announced it will make another attempt to land on the moon, following a mission that ended in failure last year. At a news conference Wednesday, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) chairman K. Sivan said that the government has approved a third lunar mission. The mission, named Chandrayaan-3 — which means “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit — will include a new propulsion module, moon lander and rover, Sivan said.  Powered by RubiQube Ad Network
