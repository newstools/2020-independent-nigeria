LAGOS – The national leadership of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has insisted that all the members of its party in Imo State House of Assembly who defected to All Progressives Congress (APC) must lose their seats in the house. The national leadership of the party on a statement made available to journalists on Wednesday night by Kola Ologbondiyan, National Publicity Secretary, said it received report that some members of the Imo State House of Assembly elected on the platform of its great party, had decided to abdicate the mandate they hold on the pedestal of the party, to defect to the APC ostensibly for their very selfish gains. The party described such action as unpatriotic and an unpardonable betrayal of the people of their respective constituencies who chose and identified with the ideals and visions of the PDP as the platform for their representation at the state assembly.

The party stressed that the defectors were fully aware of the grave implication of their actions to the effect that by their defection to the APC, they had automatically lost their seats and membership of the Imo state House of Assembly as they could only hold such positions on the mandate of the party on which they were elected. “It is settled under the 1999 Constitution (as amended), that a legislator who defects from a party upon which he was elected a member of a legislative house automatically losses his or her membership of that house as the seat belongs to the political party upon which platform the election was won and not the individual.”
