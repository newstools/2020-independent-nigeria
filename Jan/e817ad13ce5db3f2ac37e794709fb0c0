The Northern Youths Assembly (NYA) has advised Zamfara Government to shelve its proposed N7 billion Government House project in the best interest of the people. This is contained in a statement signed by Mr. Mannir Haidara, the state’s NYA Chairman in Gusau on Monday. The Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Bala Bello, had last week announced plans for the project in the 2020 budget.

Haidara said NYA is a Non-Government Organisation (NGO) working towards ensuring transparency and accountability in all Northern states.
