BENIN – A section of the popular Urhokpota Hall in Benin City, the Edo State capital, was on Saturday razed by a midnight fire. Urhokpota (‘Okpota’s gate’) hall was first built during the reign of Oba Ozolua in the 15th century and was reconstructed in 1906 and used for coronation activities of a new Oba of Benin. It is at the Urhokpota hall that a new Oba is usually first unveiled to the people and his chosen name made known to the kindred. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Governor Godwin Obaseki first declared his intention to run for governor at the Urhokpota hall in 2015. The fire was said to have been put out by combined efforts of Ogbe community as the Edo Fire Service refused to turn up. One of the hall attendants, Mr. Moses Obamwonyi, said he received an anonymous call that his office was on fire. Obamwonyi said he quickly got to the place and ensured that the fire was put out. According to him, “I asked a neighbour to take me here. I got there and went to the Fire Service Department and they said they were handicapped. They said besides having no water, their trucks were bad. “I took the risk and put off the electrical switch. I ran to Ogbe community and shouted for help, that Urhokpotawas on fire. “The community came out and we went to Ethiopia Publishing Company’s premises. They allowed us use the water there. It was the water and help from the community members that enabled us to curtail the fire. “It would have gotten worse if not the cooperation of Ogbe community. This place would have become debris.” Chairman, Oredo local government, Mr. Jelkins Osunde, could not be reached for comments.
