A smiling Meghan Markle has taken Archie and her two dogs for a walk in Vancouver as her husband Harry also beamed as he landed in Canada last night after racing through one of his final royal engagements in London. The Duchess of Sussex was followed by two royal protection officers as she walked through the Horth Hill Regional Park near the opulent £10million [$14million] Vancouver Island mansion they have used since Thanksgiving last year. Meghan was wrangling her black Labrador Oz and beagle Guy while appearing to struggle to keep eight-month-old Archie in her baby carrier with one of the straps slipping off her shoulder.

Harry has been reunited with his wife and son at the oceanfront mansion where Meghan and Archie have spent most of the past two months. Yesterday he rushed through morning meetings with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and several heads of state at the UK-Africa Investment Summit in Greenwich, arriving at around 11 am and leaving by 1 pm UK time. He then held a meeting with his Kensington Palace team about managing his and Meghan’s affairs because they will now be in Canada for the foreseeable future. The Duke even dodged his brother William’s first solo reception at Buckingham Palace and rushed to Heathrow to catch a 5.30 pm British Airways flight to Vancouver International – before catching a smaller WestJet plane to Victoria Airport on Vancouver Island, arriving at 9.45 pm local time. The father-of-one was seen grinning as he got off the plane and completed his 5,000-mile journey wearing a padded coat, blue jeans, and a beanie hat and carrying a green bag as he walked across the Tarmac.
