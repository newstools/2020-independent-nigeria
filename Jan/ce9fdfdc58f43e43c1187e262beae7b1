Iran’s government on Monday denied a “cover-up” after it took days for the armed forces to admit a Ukrainian airliner was shot down by mistake last week. “In these sorrowful days, many criticisms were directed at relevant officials and authorities… some officials were even accused of lying and a cover-up but, in all honesty, that was not the case,” government spokesman Ali Rabiei said in remarks aired on state television. Amid reports of the third day of demonstrations against the government over the downing the plane, Tehran’s police chief also denied on Monday that officers had fired on protesters in the capital on Sunday. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network In a statement carried by the state broadcaster’s website on Monday, Hossein Rahimi said: “At protests, police absolutely did not shoot because the capital’s police officers have been given orders to show restraint.” Videos posted late on Sunday recorded gunshots in the vicinity of protests in Tehran’s Azadi Square. Wounded people were being carried and security personnel could be seen running with rifles. Other posts showed riot police hitting protesters with batons as people nearby shouted: “Don’t beat them!” Footage circulating on social media showed protesters shouting “Death to the dictator,” aimed at Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the system of clerical rule. Middle East Eye could not independently authenticate the footage. State-affiliated media reported the protests on Saturday and Sunday in Tehran and other cities, without giving such details. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the shooting down of the plane a “disastrous mistake”, while a top commander said he had told the authorities on the day of the crash it had been shot down, raising questions about why Iran had initially denied it.
