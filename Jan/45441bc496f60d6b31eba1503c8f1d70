The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Command in Niger State has confirmed the death of three people in an auto crash along Bida-Kutigi Road in Bida Local Government Area of the state. The state FRSC Sector Commander, Joel Dagwa, confirmed this in an interview with newsmen on Saturday in Minna. Dagwa said the accident, which occurred on Friday, involved an articulated vehicle without a registration number and a bus, with registration SHA 683 XA. He said that nine people were involved in the accident, but three died, while six sustained various degrees of injury. “We have deposited the corpses at Federal Medical Centre Bida,” Dagwa said, even as he attributed the incident to speeding and dangerous overtaking. Dagwa said the corps would continue to monitor road users to guard against dangerous driving in major highways in the state. “We will sustain our ongoing aggressive patrols across highways to ensure that road users adhere strictly to traffic rules and regulations to avoid road accidents,” he said.
