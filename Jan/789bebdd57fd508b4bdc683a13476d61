An amateur boxer killed his friend with a punch to the head during an argument, Dubai Criminal Court heard on Monday. The two Mexican men were drinking alcohol at their hotel room in Jebel Ali, on November 15, with about a dozen other men who all worked in the same contracting company. The pair were chatting but began to argue.

It is not clear when the man died but a forensics report revealed he suffered a brain haemorrhage. In court on Monday, the accused said the victim was his friend and he did not mean to end his life. He was charged with causing the wrongful death of his friend and with consuming alcohol without a licence. The next hearing is scheduled for January 27.
