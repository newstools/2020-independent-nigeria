An outbreak of a new coronavirus that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has killed 41 people and infected more than 1,300 globally. The virus has caused alarm because it is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. And because it is new, humans have not been able to build any immunity to it. Here is what we know so far: Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Australia confirmed on Saturday its first four cases of the Wuhan coronavirus. Onepatient is hospitalised in stable condition in a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria health officials said. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard praised the three men in Sydney for approaching doctors once their symptoms arose.
