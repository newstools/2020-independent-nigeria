The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has said it has so far enrolled over two million people in Kano State as at the end of December 2019. The commission’s state coordinator, Mr Mohammed Auwal-Sanusi, disclosed this in an interview with newsmen on Monday in Kano. “As at December 31, 2019, we have enrolled 2, 016,987 people across the 44 local government areas of the state. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Lagos State is currently leading with the enrolment figure of 4.8 million people, followed by Kaduna State with 2.3 million people,” the coordinator said. He attributed the low level of turnout of clients to the level of literacy and public awareness as major reasons behind the disparity between Kano State and the two other states. “Kaduna State has recently initiated a project which is aimed at registering houses and residents of the state, by mobilising buses that go to rural areas to capture people.”
