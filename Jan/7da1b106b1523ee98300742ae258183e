Three Nigerian children have been killed in a car crash in Northeastern Ontario, Canada on New Year’s Day. The children, according to the police on Thursday, were siblings under the age of 12. Destiny Osagie, 11, and his brother Flourish, 10, were pronounced dead at the scene. Their six-year-old sister, Britney Osagie, was taken to hospital, but later pronounced dead as well. The accident left their 10-year-old friend in hospital with life-threatening injuries, The Globe and Mail reports. Constable Michelle Coulombe said officers are still investigating the crash, which saw a vehicle carrying members of two families strike a rock-cut near a highway shortly before 9 am Wednesday. Mr Coulombe added that the four children and their mothers were travelling back to their homes in Chelmsford, Ontario, just outside Sudbury, in a 2007 Honda Accord at the time of the crash. He also said both families were part of the Greater Sudbury Area’s Nigerian community and had called the region home for some time. The Osagies’ 45-year-old mother, who was behind the wheel at the time of the crash, was not injured in the collision. Coulombe said another 45-year-old woman, the mother of the 10-year-old boy, sustained minor injuries and has already been released from hospital. With investigation still in its early stages, the constable said police have already determined alcohol was not a factor in the crash.
