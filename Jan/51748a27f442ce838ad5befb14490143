LAGOS – Sequel to the one-day seminar on sanitation and security for market leaders in Lagos State organised by the wife of state governor, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, series of commendations have continued to pour in for the governor’s wife and her assistant, Oluremi Hamzat, the deputy governor’s spouse. On behalf of the stakeholders, the Iyalaje General of Lagos, Toyin Afolabi, while speaking with journalists at the weekend, commended the organisers for putting such an epic event together. She assured that what just started as a joke would in the nearest future, transform the whole market environment and improve the security of entire markets in Lagos. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Afolabi, who maintained that the Lagos First Lady should be commended for coming up with the programme at this time, recalled that such an event took place more than six years ago during the leadership of the late Iyaloja General, Mama Abibatu Mogaji. She lamented that since then, nothing like such had happened, adding, “Let us all as a matter of importance, appreciate the timely intervention of the wife of our dear governor and her team in COWLSO. I can assure you that this time around, it would benefit all of us as stakeholders. “There are so many things that are not known to us as market leaders. The leadership of the market is not only about merry-making; we do a lot of commerce, but there are other things that would aid our work, that would make our trade easy to do, and that is the sanitation and security of where we trade everyday,” Afolabi said
