Rangers will face Heartland FC in an oriental derby in the ongoing Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) match day 12 at the Okigwe Township Stadium. Okolie told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Saturday that “victory is the only language in the club at the moment. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Rangers needed to have the taste of victory once more in the ongoing NPFL because the club has gone seven matches in the league without a win. “We need to start winning matches and it will be a thing of joy if we start it with an oriental derby in Okigwe,” he said. The club’s spokesman said that the Flying Antelopes were back and good to get a victory in the match, adding that all departments of the team were now good to go. “The players are brimming with confidence and have gone through a lot of transformation under the tutelage of a technically sound coach as Salisu Yusuf,” he said. He said that the team was doing well but that the results were not forthcoming. “We are doing well in terms of performance but the results have refused to come but things are beginning to change. “The goals are now coming, so the players will deliver the good in Okigwe to begin the year 2020 in a positive way,” he said. He said that the club’s recent draw against Nuoadhibuo FC of Mauritania in the CAF Confederation Cup encounter showed there had been a lot of improvement. “We have improved in the defence, there is easy transition now from the back line to the striking force,” Okolie said. NAN reports that Rangers have played seven matches without a win and now occupied the 20th position on the log with six points after eight matches.
