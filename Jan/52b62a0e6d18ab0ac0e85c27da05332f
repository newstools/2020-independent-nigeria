UYO – The apex socio-cultural or­ganisation in Ekid nation, Ekid Union, have cried out to Governor Udom Emmanuel over the neglect of Eket and Esit Eket local government areas in the development agenda of the state govern­ment. The group lamented that in spite of the fact that Eket and Esit Eket are core oil-producing areas contrib­uting to nation’s oil wealth; they have continued to be unfairly treated. In a communiqué issued at the end of its national con­gress at Udo Edukere Coun­cil Hall, Uquo, in Esit Eket on Tuesday, the group noted that Eket and Esit Eket had have been neglected and de­prived of key infrastructure especially roads. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The communiqué signed by the group’s president, Professor Asindi Asindi, and chairman planning committee of the congress, Professor Des Wilson, made available to our correspon­dent, the group listed the woes and pains suffered of the Ekid nation. The group said, “The sto­ry of Ekid Nation as far as oil exploration is concerned has been a litany of woes and pains. “The people of Ekid over the years have suffered pain­fully from environmental degradation, resource de­pletion and deprivation as well as biodiversity losses arising from continuous gas flaring, incessant oil spills with very low access to the benefits of oil and gas explo­ration in their land. This situation is very appalling and pathetic. “The people of Ekid are not unmindful of the sin­cere developmental strides of the state governor gener­ally, but the union observed with reservations the slow pace of infrastructural de­velopment of Eket and Esit Eket LGAs specifically in the area of roads, and wish to state that Ekid Nation, in spite of its contributions, is a deprived nation through a seeming denial of infra­structure.
