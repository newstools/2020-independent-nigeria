Akure â€“ Equipment and tools worth several millions of naira in the Skill Acquisition Centre of Akoko Anglican Grammar School, Arigidi-Akoko in Ondo State were on Sunday gutted by fire. Sources disclosed that all equipment and tools being used at the training centre, including machines, sewing machines, hairdryer and other valuables, were reduced to ashes by the inferno. Residents around the school were said to have informed the principal of the college, Mr. Afe Ajulo, about the fire that raged for about one hour around 9:00am, but it was too late as nothing could be done to put out the fire. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Akoko Anglican Grammar School was among few secondary schools and the only one in Akoko that benefitted from the Ondo State government UNDP-assisted project during the late Dr. Olusegun Agagu-led administration. Meanwhile, a firefighter, who did not want his name in print, disclosed that there was no functional firefighting vehicle in Ikare-Akoko fire station for over a year, which is the nearest fire station to the scene of the incident. This was said to have been responsible for inability to save the millions of naira equipment and tools from the inferno. However, Razak Rauf, Police Area Commander for Ikare-Akoko, assured that his men would visit the scene of the incident to know the magnitude of damage.
