Uyo – A photojournalist, Godwin Sunday, and other journalists accredited by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were manhandled by armed thugs manning the gate of Independence High School, Ukana, Akwa Ibom State, during the Appeal Court-ordered rerun polls on Saturday. No observer or member of the Nigerian Union of Journalists(NUJ) crew were allowed into the polling unit by the thugs, despite the heavy presence of security personnel including men of the Nigerian Army, Police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and Road Safety. A visit to units across the area revealed that voting commenced as early as 9 am. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network One of the polling officers,  a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member,  who spoke with newsmen, said the materials arrived early and voting began at the unit by 8.30 am. He said there was no challenge as the card readers were working optimally. At Ward 9 unit 17 and 18, voters were seen casting their votes. It was, however, observed that there were no APC agents in some of the polling stations visited in Essien Udim LGA. At Ward 9 Unit 30, the Electoral Officer, Mrs Anietie Udo, said everything was peaceful as voters were orderly while casting their votes. She, however, reported that the only challenge encountered was the ink pad meant for thumb-printing for voters who have cast their ballots. She said the polling unit had to use ink from regular pens as an alternative.
