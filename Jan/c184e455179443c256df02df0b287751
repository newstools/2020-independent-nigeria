Turkey has restored access to online encyclopedia Wikipedia after the official publication of a Constitutional Court ruling that the more than two-year block was a violation of freedom of expression. The detailed version of the ruling published in the Official Gazette on Wednesday opened the way for an end to the ban put in place in April 2017. Ankara has accused Wikipedia of being part of a “smear campaign” against the country, after the website refused to remove content that allegedly portrayed Turkey as supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) group and other organisations.
