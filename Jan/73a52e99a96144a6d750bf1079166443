The Gambling Commission, which polices the gambling industry, has said it will stop betters using credit cards. Neil McArthur, the Gambling Commission’s chief executive, says: “Our role is to make gambling safer, and today we’re announcing a ban on using credit cards to gamble, as the evidence shows it can lead to significant harm. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “We know that 24 million adults gamble, and we know that 10.5 million adults gamble online. We also know that 300,000 adults are problem gamblers, with more at risk of experiencing problems from gambling, and that’s simply unacceptable and needs to dramatically reduce.” “In relation to credit cards, UK Finance suggested in the evidence they gave us that 800,000 people use credit cards to gamble, and our research suggests that more than 20% of those credit card gamblers are problem gamblers, and more are at risk, and that’s why we’ve taken action.”
