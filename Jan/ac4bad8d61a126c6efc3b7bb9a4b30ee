The prosecution team of Dr. Ben Ubi and Sanusi Galadanchi, called five witnesses, including two victims of his money laundering activities, to prove their case, while the accused called three witnesses. Justice Adetoro found him guilty on four of the six charges, sentencing him to two years on count two, three years each on counts three and four and five years  on count six with N1,000,000 option of fine. The jail terms are to run concurrently. Justice Olubanjo, however, modified the sentence to a suspended six months community service, having yielded to the application made by the defence counsel based on convict’s poor health, academic pursuit and the fact that he had refunded all the money he fraudulently collected. However, the suspended sentence would be revoked unless the convict observes the six months community service without default. According to the judge, if the convict misses one day of the six months community service, the original sentence will take effect.
