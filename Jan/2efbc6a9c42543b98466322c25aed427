An outbreak of a new coronavirus that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has killed 41 people and infected more than 1,300 globally. The virus has caused alarm because it is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. And because it is new, humans have not been able to build an immunity to it. Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. China says the virus is mutating and can be transmitted through human contact. Those most affected are older people and those with underlying health conditions. Three research teams have begun work on developing potential vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said.
