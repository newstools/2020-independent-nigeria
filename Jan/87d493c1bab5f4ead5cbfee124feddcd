AWKA – The former Governor of Anambra State and  Vice Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Peter Obi battled to hold back tears at Patterson Grammar school, Awada , Onitsha, owned and managed by the Anglican Diocese where a dormitory of the school was burnt killing one student. Obi, while sympathising with the school described the fire incident as a national calamity and should be treated as such. Obi said he had watched with sadness where incidents that did not have much impact were designated as “national calamities”, while our leaders did not view the burning of schools with the seriousness it deserves. “If it were to be in countries that knew the value of education, all manner of organisations would have visited the school and offered their support,” he said. He donated N1million as support for the school, and promised to return to offer more assistance. Earlier, Obi had visited Ekwulumili in Idemili North local council to condole with the family of the student that lost his life in the inferno. There, the Bishop on the Niger, Most Rev. Owen Nwokolo who was represented by the principal of the school, Rev. Dr. Cajetan Anuforo thanked Obi for his consistent love and support for education nationwide and urged other Nigerians to emulate his life of service. He also pleaded with Obi to assist in bringing the issue of merit to the front burner of the national consciousness#
