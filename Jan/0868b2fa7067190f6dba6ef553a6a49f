LAGOS – Chuks Nwachuku, a lawyer and presidential candidate of All Grassroots Alliance (AGA) in the 2019 election, has said the inability of the Supreme Court to maintain standards in its judgments has the potential of eroding its credibility. Nwachukwu, who spoke to Daily Independent on Monday, said that giving judgments which the people do not understand would make it difficult for people to follow the Supreme Court. He stressed that at a legal point that the judgments of the apex court is final, making people accept the judgments on the ground of finality, backed by coerciveness of state, would only make people lose confidence and trust in the court.

They will only accept the judgment on the ground that it is final and that is a very good way to start anarchy. “At most trying time in the history of this country, people trusted the Supreme Court, but today, that credibility is fast eroding because politicians who change parties like chameleon have taken over the space, and the Supreme Court can no longer sustain the court,” he said. Nwachukwu wondered why the court could not apply the same standard it used for Imo governorship appeal to the Kano governorship appeal, stressing that Nigerians should be able to trust the Justices who constitute members of the Supreme Court panels. He said that people should not be compelled to accept Supreme Court judgments on the ground that might belonged to the court, insisting it was very dangerous for the court and could cost the court its credibility.
