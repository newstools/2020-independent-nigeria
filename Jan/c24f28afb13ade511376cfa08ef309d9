It was goals galore for Nigerian female football stars in Spain, as Super Falcons’ skipper, Asisat Oshoala showed the way with two strikes for Barcelona Femeni, while Osinachi Ohale and Modupe Antoniette Payne struck one each for CD Tacon, while Joyce Ubogagu hit one as well for Sevilla Ladies. Oshoala got off the bench to strike twice in the last 30 minutes for Barca, and help her side beat Athletic Club 3-0 in Sunday’s Spanish Primera Iberdrola fixture, which saw her side take a seven-point lead atop the log. The three-time African Women Footballer of The Year, who will be going for a record equaling fourth title this Tuesday at the CAF Awards in Egypt, went on for the fifth time as a substitute, but still managed to knock in her ninth and 10th goals as well as her third brace in 13 league games so far this season. Oshoala first struck when she got a cross from Kheira Hamraoui and headed home from close range to double the visitors’ advantage in the 77th minute, then returned four minutes from full time to knock home a second from a goalmouth melee. On the same evening in Spain, Oshoala’s national team pal, Osinachi roe from her position in defence to make hay in her ninth match since joining Real Madrid’s female team, Tacon, who trounced Sevilla 5-1 at Estadio Canillas.
