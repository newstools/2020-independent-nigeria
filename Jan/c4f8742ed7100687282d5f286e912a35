OWERRI – Amidst mixed reactions still trailing the ruling of the Supreme Court, which sacked Rt. Hon. Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and declared Senator Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the duly elected governor of Imo State, president of the Owerri Zonal Mandate Forum, Chief Clems Onyeali, has warned politicians in the state against unguarded utterances and actions that could demoralise the new governor from hitting the ground running. Onyeali, a community leader in Mbieri, Mbaitoli council area of the state, argued that the people should shun such actions, utterances and conducts that could make Uzodima depart from his set objectives, making him to go astray, urging Imo people not leave the substance to pursue shadows. Onyeali, who spoke to Daily Independent, recalled the verdict of the nation’s apex court, noting that both the Election Petition Tribunal and the Appeal Court erred in their decisions, just as he hailed the Supreme Court for its wise ruling.

I am neither of the PDP, nor of the APC. But, I just want to be sincere and to demonstrate my love for our dear state.”
