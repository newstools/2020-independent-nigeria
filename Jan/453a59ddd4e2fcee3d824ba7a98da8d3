A high school has faced backlash from parents and members of the public after a shocking question on a biology homework assignment went viral. The question is thought to have been given out to around 90 students aged 14 and 15-years-old at Klein Collins High School in Houston and was about rape. It read: “Suzy was assaulted in an alley and is a victim of rape. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “The police collected a sample of sperm that was left at the crime scene and now have three suspects in custody. Which of the suspects raped Suzy?” Students were asked to answer either S1, S2 or S3 and compare each of the DNA sequences to the “felon”. Parents of pupils at the school had very strong reactions, with one branding it “upsetting”. Mum Cookie VonHaven, who has a daughter in the 10th grade, said: “It’s upsetting and I know girls this age, just the thought … they know that rape is forced non-consensual sex and that upsets them. “That’s why I can’t fathom a teacher putting that on a test.” Similarly, Dana Duplantier who has a ninth-grader, couldn’t believe that a teacher had approved the question. She asked: “Wouldn’t [the teacher] have to get that approved by the school board or teachers or something to put that in there?” Following the backlash, the School District released a statement on the homework question. They said: “The assignment is not part of the District’s approved curriculum and is by no means representative of the District’s instructional philosophy. “The District has investigated the source of the materials and appropriate corrective action has been taken.” The District did not comment on what the “corrective action” was.
