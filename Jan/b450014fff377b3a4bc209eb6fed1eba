The company’s latest report, ‘Global Planned Oil and Gas Pipelines Industry Outlook to 2023, Capacity and Capital Expenditure Outlook with Details of All Planned Pipelines’, reveals that Nigeria is expected to provide 6601.5 km of new-build pipeline by 2023. Most of the additions will constitute natural gas, at 6460 km, while crude oil pipelines will account for 142 km.

This announced natural gas pipeline is expected to start operations in 2021.” Niger has the second highest new-build pipeline additions in Africa with two new-build pipelines, Niger-Benin and Zinder-Torodi pipelines are expected to start operations with lengths of 1980 km and 1070 km, respectively by 2023. Niger-Benin is a crude oil pipeline, while Zinder-Torodi is a petroleum products pipeline.
