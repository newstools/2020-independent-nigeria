Over the past few days, Manchester United captain Ashley Young has been heavily linked with a move to Inter Milan. On January 16th, we covered claims made by Sky Italia that the two clubs are ‘close’ to finding an agreement for the 34-year-old’s transfer. The Serie A side will pay a fee of around €1.5m to the Red Devils. Calciomercato also relayed claims made by Sky Italia and added Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side and Inter have found an agreement for €1.5m plus bonuses. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Inter will offer the former Aston Villa man an 18-month contract worth about €6m, but the website doesn’t make it clear if this figure is for one-and-a-half years or per season.  Sky Italia have published images of Young arriving at Milan Malpensa Airport and this comes just an hour after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted the utility player will move elsewhere. Calciomercato claimed Giuseppe Marotta wanted Chelsea’s Marcos Alonso for Inter, but after failing to sign the Spaniard, the Italian side shifted their focus to Young.
