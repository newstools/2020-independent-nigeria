Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A close friend who spoke on the condition of anonymity told PREMIUM TIMES that the late novelist’s health had deteriorated ever since his only son’s death in 2016. His son, Ositadinma Ike, had married a daughter of a Benin Chief, Osarunwense Eghosa, but the marriage hit rock bottom at the last days of Ositadinma. Though blessed with a son named after the late novelist, Chukwuemeka Junior, family disagreements meant the Ike family no longer had access to Chukwuemeka Jnr. after their son’s death. The event was said to have saddened the writer who longed to see his only grandchild and heir. “When I saw him during the last Christmas, he was really heart-broken and was in deep trauma over his inability to meet his grandchild,” the close associate told PREMIUM TIMES. There was a public appeal made by Mr Ike’s close friends who worried over Mr Ike’s broken heart to find the whereabouts of Chukwuemeka Jnr. Until his death, the boy’s whereabouts remained unknown. Mr Ike is survived by his wife, Adebimpe Ike. Source: PREMIUM TIMES
