Apple’s iOS 13 comes with multiple new security and privacy features intended to help users lock down their iPhones. But these very features are now coming under fire from users and developers, who say they can be annoying and are killing apps’ functionality. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, because the updated iPhone operating system reminds people “again and again” that they are being tracked, it might be more of a hindrance than a help to privacy. Since Apple’s iOS 13 launched, pop-ups will appear on your device saying for example: “Facebook has used your location 120 times in the background over the last three days. Do you want to continue to allow background location use?” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Central to the issue is the fact that the “Always Allow” option doesn’t do exactly as it says: instead reminders do eventually pop up again to ensure users are aware of app tracking. Critics say this could result in people getting annoyed, rather than encouraging them to protect their privacy using iOS 13, according to Forbes cyber-security reporter. Developers are worried that this will scare users away and disengage them from their apps–but it should be noted that developers have already complained about these new Apple features, which stop them from tracking people’s location as they had in the past. It comes as Apple is being scrutinized by lawmakers, who say that some of the firm’s own location tracking functions do not have to play by the same rules as the likes of Facebook and Google. Apple said in response to the Wall Street Journal that the firm “has not built a business model on knowing a customer’s location or the location of their device.”
