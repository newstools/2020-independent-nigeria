Ebute, in a letter addressed to Lawan, said all hands must be on deck in the fight against insurgency, which he stressed should not be left for the Service Chiefs or Mr. President alone. “It is time for you to convoke and lead the North East reconciliation and peace to end Boko Haram/ ISWAP terrorism: Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Without the hard and sustained mitigation of the Buhari Presidency, Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorism would have overwhelmed and conquered Nigeria by now. “Nigerian military, especially, the Nigerian Army, led by the COAS and leader of the counter-insurgency operations, Lt.Gen.

Ebute was reacting to the recent call by the National Assembly on President Buhari to sack his Service Chiefs over the security situation in the country
