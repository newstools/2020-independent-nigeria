BAUCHI – No fewer than 596 dead civil servants in Bauchi State are still in the payroll of the Bauchi State government for several years. This was disclosed by the verification committee set up by the state government to ascertain the number of civil servants in the state as part of efforts to determine the actual salaries and allowances to be paid on monthly basis. While briefing newsmen on the activities of the committee, its chairman, Adamu Ibrahim Gumba, disclosed that during the assignment which took about three months, 4,578 civil servants and pensioners declined to appear before it.

He added that a total of 24,736 people made up of state workers and local government workers as well as pensioners have been verified and cleared by the committee and have started receiving their salaries and allowances. On those who abdicated to appear before the committee, Gumba said that they would have another chance to be verified by the implementation committee to be set up, adding that they were suspects and everything must be done to identify them. “All those verified and cleared by the committee that have not received their three months salaries and allowances will now be paid without any further delay as already, the state governor, Sen Bala Mohammed Abdulkadir, has approved the immediate payment of the arrears of the salaries,” Gumba said. He expressed the hope that whatever amount would be saved from the exercise would be used by the government to improve the welfare of the state civil service for optimum delivery.
