UMUAHIA – A former staff of defunct Nigerian Telecommunication Limited (NITEL), Chief I. k. Onyeama, has applauded President Muhammadu Buhari for ensuring the regular payment of pensions to all former staff of the defunct first national telecommunication outfit. Onyeama, who gave the commendation when he visited the NUJ Press Centre in Umuahia, told DAILY INDEPENDENT that the living conditions of former staff of the former Federal Government parastatal after the winding down of defunct NITEL by former President Olusegun Obasanjo had been most unbearable and a walk through the tunnel of death. He disclosed that soon after the winding down of the company, their source of livelihood without the payment of some of their entitlements which included pensions and gratuities, many had died due to years of abandonment by successive administrations.

He did this without obvious lapses that are associated with such life-saving ventures,” Onyeama continued “The president’s intervention came at the right time, taking into cognisance that many of us were about to die, while many others were already down with sicknesses. He emphasised that the ill-fated privatisation of NITEL rendered many staff of the telecommunication giant hopeless, but thanked God that he and other surviving retirees now received their pensions regularly, after being verified. On how they survived before the Federal Government’s intervention, Onyeama recalled, “For many years, we were abandoned to fate, some died of sicknesses, others went into menial jobs to survive. “But, I never lost hope. I believed that God would intervene and my prayers were later actualised through President Buhari-led Federal Government.”
