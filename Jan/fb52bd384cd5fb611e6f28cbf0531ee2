Rio Ferdinand has hammered Manchester United’s recruitment strategy following their defeat to Burnley and questioned the signings of six players. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side slipped to their second consecutive defeat and eighth league loss of the season against Sean Dyche’s team on Wednesday night and the performance led to plenty of questions about the United board and how the club is run. The fans were vocal in their discontent towards the Glazers and Ed Woodward and Ferdinand also took aim at the club’s executive vice chairman, as he questioned the club’s strategy.

Were these players ever really United players? “For different reasons, either mentality, ability, style of play, were they ever really Manchester United players?” “And that’s what I was a lot of the time getting baffled with, who’s buying these players? Is it a manager coming in, ‘I want these players for now?’, or is it the club saying ‘no, hold on. we’re going to buy for now but also future proof the club as well.’ And I don’t think that was coming into consideration.” Last month Solskjaer insisted that he was the one who has the final say on transfers as he tries to rebuild his United squad. “I will always have the final say. I am not going to let any players in the door without me saying yes definitely,” Solskjaer said. “It has to be that way. it is a good process and of course if I don’t like a player I don’t want him there.”
