U.S. Vice President Mike Pence met Friday with Pope Francis during a visit to Rome that includes meetings with the Italian president and premier. The audience comes on the same day that President Donald Trump is attending a big anti-abortion rally in Washington, the first sitting U.S. president to do so in the March for Life’s history. Pence, his wife and daughter-in-law were greeted at Rome’s Ciampino airport by the U.S ambassador to the Holy See, Callista Gingrich, and her husband Newt, the former U.S Speaker of the House who oversaw the impeachment proceedings against then-President Bill Clinton.
