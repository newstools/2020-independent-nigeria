LAGOS – Chioma Ajunwa, former Nigeria sprint star and Olympic medalist has advised that Nigeria should commence preparations for the next Olympics in France as she believes the athletes would not perform in Tokyo Olympics. The 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, USA long jump gold medalist speaking on Nigeria’s preparations for the global sports jamboree in a television sports interview in Lagos said the no activities in the country for the athletes is an indication unseriousness for Games. She quarried the magic Nigeria could perform in Tokyo as serious countries are not only already organising training and camp activities for their athletes but are perfecting their trainings. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “I don’t think Nigeria is ready for 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Other countries that really want to perform in the Olympics are currently training and doing their competitions, taking them out to compete. But here we start our training within 2 to 3 months; it is not good that way. “I don’t think we are going to Tokyo to compete and win but I believe if we really want to do that, we should know what to do. “My advice is that we need to start in time so that we will be able to go there, compete with others and make an impact. Even if we could not get a medal, but let it be that we prepared and did very well to marvel the world. Not we get there and everybody is eliminated at the prelim, yet we are spending billions of naira. Why not give the athletes the money to prepare themselves for the next coming one instead of going there to waste it?” she advised. Stakeholders have been raising eyebrows over the crisis at the Athletic Nigeria Federation (AFN) as it is believed could jeopardise the preparations and performance of the team at the sports fiesta.
