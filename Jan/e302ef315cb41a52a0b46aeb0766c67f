The boss of the electric carmaker has a $50bn pay package ready to roll if the firm hits a $100bn valuation. One of the options on a fully loaded Tesla is “ludicrous mode”, a setting offering a 0-60mph acceleration time of 2.8 seconds for drivers who find its “insane mode” too sedate. To some investors, that’s similar to chief executive Elon Musk’s bonus package: if the electric carmaker’s share price goes above $554.80 – which would value the firm at $100bn, and which it came very close to last week – the mercurial entrepreneur could reap the first $350m instalment of a potential $50bn share-based pay package. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network In the event, Tesla didn’t break through the key $100bn valuation last week – its share price was affected by new Chinese GDP figures showing the slowest growth in 29 years and a stock downgrade which together pushed Tesla’s shares below $500. Still, rising demand in Europe and China, coupled with record deliveries, has contributed to a remarkable change of fortune for the world’s leading electric-vehicle maker, which has pushed its shares up nearly 180% since last summer. Last year, Tesla’s stock sank as low as $179 in the aftermath of Twitter comments by Musk that he planned to take the company private. There were production problems, and regulators forced Musk to relinquish his chairmanship and pay a $20m fine. But six months later, Tesla was in turnaround. Its stock price more than doubled from October to December, and has climbed another 24% this year to a peak on Wednesday, helped by a surprise third-quarter profit, fourth-quarter delivery numbers that beat expectations, and the first cars rolling off the production line at Tesla’s new “Gigafactory” in Shanghai.
