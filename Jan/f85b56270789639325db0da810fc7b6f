The UK’s broadcasting unions have criticized the government over yesterday’s announcement of job cuts at BBC News, as part of the broadcaster’s plans to save £80 million by 2022. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) have described the cutbacks, which include 450 redundancies at Newsnight, BBC Radio 5 Live, the World Service and The Victoria Derbyshire Show, as “part of an existential threat to the BBC.” “The BBC’s very existence is being threatened with public service broadcasting under unprecedented threat,” said NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet. “If the government goes ahead and decriminalizes non-payment of the license fee, we know the impact will be further losses for the BBC of around £200 million a year and increased collection costs of £45 million.
