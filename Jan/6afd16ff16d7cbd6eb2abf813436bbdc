ENUGU – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) secretariat in Nsukka local government area has been set ablaze by persons suspected to be aggrieved party members. The incident might not be unconnected with the disaffection of members with the party over the handling of party primaries for the February 29 local government elections in the state. It was gathered that some aspirants in Nsukka were kicking against the alleged hijack of the primaries by the party leadership to favour preferred candidates. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network According to eyewitness account, people who live near the PDP secretariat at Nsukka suddenly noticed smoke coming out of the building and before anything could be done, fire engulfed a section of the building. The fire would have gutted the entire building, but for the swift intervention of men of the fire service, who responded to a distress call. However, the fire gutted a section of the building housing the office of the local government party chairman,  Mr. Fabian Onah. Onah, who spoke with journalists on Saturday, said he was alerted in the morning that fire gutted the secretariat and he rushed to the place. He said on getting to the place, he saw that the fire had gutted his entire office, adding that the incident must have been politically motivated as only his office was targeted. He said the persons behind the arson scaled the fence, smashed the glass windows and ignited fire in his office, stressing that all vital documents there were destroyed. Onah said he was at loss what must have prompted the arsonists to set his office, with all vital documents therein, ablaze. Efforts by our correspondent to speak with the new police spokesman in Enugu, Daniel Ndukwe, to comment on the incident, yielded no fruits as his mobile phone line was not reachable as at press time.
