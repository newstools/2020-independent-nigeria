LAGOS – Bishop Amakiri, national chairman of Young Progressives Party (YPP) has suggested that the creation of Election Crime Commission to deal with cases of political and electoral offences would be necessary to deepen the nation’s democracy. Amakiri maintained that electronic voting system must be introduced and stressed that it was not a rocket science, but a system that had worked in other countries of the world. He described as the bane of democracy in the country leaders who were transactional instead of transformational and called for attitudinal change among politicians. He maintained that a situation where some politicians have an established attitude that they are the owners of the electoral process and determine who wins elections should be discarded. The YPP leader said that the country should break away from internal political slavery, ensure that the influence of the executive on elections are curtailed, stressing that the creation of Election Crime Commission should be part of the electoral reform. Speaking further on a programme on a local media on Thursday, Amakiri said the commission should be truly independent and saddled with the responsibility of managing all electoral and political offences. He pointed out that, though there was a high level of violence, the low turnout of voters, during the 2019 general elections compared with 2015, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), expanded the scope for political parties to participate, unlike what happened in 2015. Dr Chima Amadi, Executive Director, Centre for Transparency and Advocacy said that the reforms should be all-encompassing, strengthen the laws and ensure adequate punishment for all those involved in election infractions. He said that political actors have remained a clog in the wheel of progress and called for checks on  stakeholders, saying that nothing is wrong with the creation of institutions for solving problems, pointing out that the proliferation of data collecting agencies had also impeded the electoral process.
