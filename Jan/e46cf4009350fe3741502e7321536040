Speaking at the official launch/flag-off ceremony of the “He For She” campaign in Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos, on Tuesday, Sanwo-Olu noted that the campaign “is a clarion call on the male gender to sign up to this initiative because it is an idea that society as a whole stands to benefit from.” Reiterating his belief in the critical role played by women in advancing the socio-economic development of the state, the governor said he was proud to accept to lead the campaign as an ambassador for the cause of women in Lagos State.
