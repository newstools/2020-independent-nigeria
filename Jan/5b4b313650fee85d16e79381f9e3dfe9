Prices of onions which had been on steady rise since September last year have started declining owing to gradual onset of its season of harvest. With improved supplies from some of its major sources such as Sokoto, Jigawa and Niger, a neighbouring country, traders had no option but to bring down the prices especially to encourage patronage and recoup their money quickly to avoid losses. Although prices of the commodity, despite the reduction appeared to be somewhat high as visits to some markets in the week under review indicated that some traders were still unable to up their purchases which were affected adversely during severe scarcity. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Still, the health benefits associated with the consumption of onions have always paved way for the commodity to continue to enjoy good level of patronage from consumers regardless of the season and cost. Findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of onions fell by over 15 and 20 percent in few markets from December 2019 to January 23, 2020, of which many of the traders linked to arrival of on-season effect resulting to improved supply. Checks at the Achau Market, Kaduna, showed that prices of a 100kg bag of onions which previously attracted between N12,800 and N13,500 declined by 17 percent, currently ranging from N10,700  to N11,500 . Mallam Salim Aliu, a trader at the Achau Market, Kaduna, linked the reduction to increased supply and poor sales. The same could be said of Dawanau Market, Kano, as prices of a 100kg bag of the produce currently go for between N9,800 to N10,000 down from N12,200 formerly sold, a situation which many of the traders ascribed to increased supply usually common with season of harvest. For Igbudu Market, Delta State, the situation was not different especially with the prices of a 100kg bag of onions currently selling within the region of N21,500 and N22,000 down from N26,000 initially sold. Most of the traders in a chat with our correspondent attributed the situation to commencement of season of plenty which usually forces prices of commodities down due to adequate supply. That of Oba Market, Benin City, Edo State, was not at variance, as visit revealed that a 100kg bag of onions dwindled to between N18,500 and N19,000 from N22,000 previously sold, representing 16 percent drop. Madam Emutan Rebecca at the Oba Market, Benin City, linked the situation to increased supply. In Nkwo Nnewi Market, Anambra State, prices of onions seemed to be more favorable than other regions in South/South/West, with a 100kg bag currently going for between N17,500 and N18,000 against N21,000 last month. Mr. Joshua Obadere who sells onions at the Nkwo Nnewi Market, Anambra State, said the decrease was a good omen, connecting it to onset of season of abundance. That of Umuahia Main Market, Abia State, was still on the high side, despite the slight decline. For example, prices of a 100kg bag of onions which earlier went for between N28,500 and N30,000 reduced marginally to between N25,000 and N26,000 but this depends on the quality and bargaining power of the customer. Many of the traders at Umuahia Main Market, Abia State, blamed the situation to high cost of transporting the produce from the North, but improved supply was responsible for the marginal drop. At the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of the produce also witnessed a sliding trend particularly with a 100kg bag reducing to between N19,500 and N20,000  from N24,000 sold before. Mr. Kareem Jimoh who trades in the commodity at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, said the reduction was a big respite, connecting it to seasonal factors, which according to him would bring down the prices further in March as harvesting would have commenced fully. For Bodija Market, Ibadan, visits showed that the prices of the produce were at a declining trend as the number of traders vending onions had actually increased owing to availability and reduction in prices of the commodity. For instance, prices of a 100kg bag of onions currently go for between N18,500 to N19,700 depending on the species and the haggling power of the customer. Many of the traders at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, attributed the drop to onset of its season of plenty. In Lagos, visit to popular Mile 12 Market where commodities are sold in wholesale and affordable prices indicated that prices of onions had dropped, particularly with the increased number of trucks from the North conveying the consignment and trying to get a space in the garage for offloading, thus causing a serious gridlock along the Ikorodu Road. Improved supplies have always had a positive effect on prices of commodities. With this, prices of a 100kg bag of onions previously sold for between N25,000 and N27,000 fell during the week, currently ranging from N18,000 to N20,000. Many of the traders at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos, connected the situation to availability and were optimistic that it would crash the more during the season of mass production commencing in March. But despite the drop, those who bought the commodity in small quantities at the Mile 12 Market, Lagos, said the effect did not reflect in their purchases considerably.
