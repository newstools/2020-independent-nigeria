Oil fell on the last trading day of the decade yesterday, but was still on track for monthly and annual gains, supported by a thaw in the prolonged U.S.-China trade row and Middle East unrest. Brent crude was down 74 cents at $65.93 a barrel by 1434 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 82 cents at $60.86 per barrel. The volume of trade remained low as many market participants were away for year-end holidays. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Brent has gained about 22% in 2019 and WTI has risen 34%. Both benchmarks are set for their biggest yearly gains in three years, backed by a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks and output cuts pledged by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the Phase 1 trade deal with China would be signed on January 15, 2020 at the White House. The breakthrough in the talks has already boosted factories’ output and Chinese manufacturing activity expanded for a second straight month. China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), an index showing economic trends in the manufacturing and service sectors, was unchanged at 50.2 in December from November, but still remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. Tensions in the Middle East also kept traders on edge as thousands of protesters and militia fighters gathered outside the U.S. embassy in Baghdad to condemn U.S. air strikes against Iraqi militias.
