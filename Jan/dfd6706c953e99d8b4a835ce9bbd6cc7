ABUJA – The Acting Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan, yesterday said Nigeria and some developing countries are yet to be included in the International Civil Service Effectiveness (InCiSE) Index due to inadequacy of relevant data needed for their assessment. Yemi-Esan, stated this in Abuja at a two-day workshop on the technical paper emanating from the assessment of the applicability of the International Civil Service Effectiveness(InCiSE) Index Methodology to Nigeria. It would be recalled that the InCiSE Index was developed to benchmark the effectiveness of the civil service in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries.

To this end, Yemi-Esan, however, tasked participants at the workshop to come up with a plan for sourcing of the needed data to ensure that existing gaps are bridged.
