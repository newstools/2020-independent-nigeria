All is now set for the take­off of a grassroots (junior golf) programme that will take the game to the pub­lic in Lagos State among schools from January 15- 17 at the Ikeja Golf Club, Lagos. The programme, an ini­tiative of the Lagos State Golf Association in con­junction with Ikeja Golf Club is expected to com­mence with an introducto­ry programme tagged, “Eko Junior Golf Clinic,” among at least, 10 schools from La­gos State. Abel Edinomo, consul­tant of the programme revealed in a statement on Thursday that the clinic is slated for the Agege Stadi­um in Lagos between Jan­uary 15 and 16 as the fund raising tournament and dinner holds on January 17. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Edinomo believes, “The programme will help the country in the discovery of talents for the Olympic Games; besides, it will also help to shape the future of the children, because golf is a lucrative game.” Biyi Fetuga, Chairman of Lagos State Golf Associ­ation also commenting on the programme expressed enthusiasm towards ensur­ing the development of the game from the grassroots in the state. “It’s imperative that we start something tangible now in taking the golf to the public through a grassroots programme; that is what is about to start now in Lagos State and the association is very serious about it. “The School Golf is all about introducing the game early to the kids and with a conscious effort at encour­aging the students to keep playing the game; it’s an employment generation scheme for the youth and also tourism development for the state and the country in general,” he explained. In this regard, individu­als and corporate organisa­tions have been encouraged to partner in the programme as part of their corporate so­cial responsibility to grow and develop the game in the country. Ikeja Golf Club inciden­tally, has pledged its support to help in the development of the game.
