Against the backdrop of the current global crisis and its impact on the oil and gas sector, President Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, met behind closed doors with Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, and Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mela Kyari. Although both top government officials refused to disclose details of the meetings, Villa sources said discussions might have centred on the fallout of the current tensions between the US and Iran and the likely implications on crude oil prices. Nigeria and other oil producing countries are already harvesting the fallout of the crisis with Brent crude already recording a rise of 2.4 percent in price in the past days, increasing a barrel price to $70.24 as of Tuesday. The meeting, which was at the instance of President Buhari, who is also the Minister of Petroleum Resources, was used to review the current state in the global oil sector, according to inside sources. It was further revealed that recent changes in global oil prices were mentioned, especially on how they would rub off on the funding of the 2020 budget of N10.59 trillion, given that the National Assembly had fixed $57 per barrel as the benchmark for the 2020 budget. “You know that crude oil remains the major source funding the budget, so whatever affects oil is taken seriously. “You would have noticed that these briefings are regular, just to keep Mr. President abreast of developments in the ministry.” “Heads of MDAs, like the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and other ministers, like that of Finance/Budget Planning, have also been holding routine meetings with Mr. President. “Yes, a meeting between Sylva and the president today may not exclude oil prices in view of the latest developments and the implications on prices for oil-dependent economies like ours,” the official added.
