Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Onboard the Open Arms there are now 158 shipwrecked people saved from likely death,” it said in a tweet. “We are the only humanitarians’ ship in the area,” it said. Almost 500 people are now seeking a safe port, Open Arms said. It was referring also to migrants rescued in the last few days by two other NGO-run rescue ships, the Ocean Viking and the Alan Kurdi. On Tuesday the Ocean Viking, with more than 400 aboard, was assigned Taranto in Puglia as a safe port. Most migrants trying to make it to Italy set off from wartorn Libya.
