Lagos – The former President, Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), Dr Samuel Nzekwe has urged the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to reduce the disparity in the saving and lending rates, saying the measure would boost the economy. He gave the charge in an interview in Ota, Ogun, on Tuesday whole speaking ahead of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting of the CBN, holding between January 23-24, 2020 in Abuja. Nzekwe advocated that bridging the interest rates gaps on saving and lending would reduce distortion in the economy.

He said: “MPC also needs to reduce the lending rate, which is currently at 13.5 per cent so that more investors can have access to loans at lower interest rate. “In addition, the Cash Reserve Ratio of 22.5 percent should be reduced in order to make funds available to the banks, so that they can borrow to grow the productive sector,’’ he said. Nzekwe said that this development would encourage the productive sector to produce at an optimal level, thus drastically reducing the country’s inflation rate.
