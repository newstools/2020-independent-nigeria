The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday disclosed that it has mobilised and validated 140,848 tomato farmers for the Anchor Borrowers Programme. Mr. Godwin Emefiele, CBN Governor, made the disclosure at the Ground-Breaking ceremony of Tomato Jos at Kangimi community in Kaduna. Tomato Jos is an American owned company aimed to transform smallholder farmers from subsistence growers into commercial producers. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The company has a 500 hectres of land with potential to cultivate tomato of 400 hectres, and it is expected to begin production in 2021. Emefiele said the beneficial farmers were selected from various tomato farmers associations across 25 states in the federation. He explained that the farmers would be linked to proximal processors where applicable, or financed to produce fresh fruits for direct consumption, which constituted the largest use of tomato in the country. “We are also partnering with other big players in the tomato value chain like Dangote Tomato Processing Limited Sonia Foods, GB Foods (GBF), Vegefresh Company Limited and a host of others. “This is with a view to ensuring that Nigeria becomes self-sufficient in tomato, and our processing companies, functioning at full capacity and employing millions of Nigerian youths. “My presence here today is a demonstration of CBN’S preparedness to partner with the private sector to facilitate the development of Nigeria’s agricultural sector through our various programmes and Schemes like Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS), Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP),” he said. Emefiele commended the management of Tomato Jos Company for flagging off this processing plant, which had the potential of creating employment for hundreds of Kaduna State indigenes and other Nigerians in general. He, however, expressed hope that the management of the company would remain focused and not be compromised so as to ensure the sustainability of the project.
