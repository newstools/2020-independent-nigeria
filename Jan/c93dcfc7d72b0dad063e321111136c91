The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) issued 124 enforcement orders to food businesses who had been found to be in breach of food safety legislation last year, it has been revealed. Between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019 food inspectors issued 107 closure orders, 13 Prohibition Orders and four improvement notices on food businesses throughout the country, an increase of 13% since 2018. Commenting on the annual figures, Dr. Pamela Byrne, chief executive, FSAI stressed the serious nature of a food business being served an enforcement order. “Enforcements, especially closure orders and prohibition orders, are never served for minor food safety breaches,” she said. “While the vast majority of food businesses are compliant with food safety legislation, we still continue to face negligent practices that are potentially putting consumers’ health at risk.” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The types of recurring food safety issues that lead to enforcement orders include evidence of rodent infestation and rodent droppings, failure to maintain correct temperatures of foodstuffs, filthy or substandard conditions, a lack of knowledge of food safety by staff, unsuitable food storage facilities; improper or lack of water facilities for cleaning and lack of equipment and workspace to allow for the safe preparation of allergen-free food. Dr Byrne added that it is crucial for businesses to remain up to date with legislation that addresses these issues, as the health of consumers could potentially be at risk.
