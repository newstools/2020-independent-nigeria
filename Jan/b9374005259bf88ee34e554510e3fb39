The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has just injected another $56.72 billion to ‘calm the markets’ as we step into 2020. The New York Fed injected the money through repurchase-agreements (repo) markets in two separate stages. The first as a $29.05 billion overnight repo and the other via a $26.67 billion repo spread across two weeks. The repo market experienced significant stress in September, with many believing that it could be unsalvageable. More than $3 trillion in debt is financed each day there through collateralized short-term loans. It’s something like the world’s biggest pawn shop, where cash and securities meet. In September, the Fed pledged a $400B bailout for this seemingly broken market largely based on debt. Overall, the fresh cash injection by the NY Fed seems to be an attempt to buy time before the consequences of this broken repo market are felt by us all.
