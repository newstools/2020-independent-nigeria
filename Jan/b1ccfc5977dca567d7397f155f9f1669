Paul Pogba has stepped up his recovery from an ankle injury to hand a much-needed boost to Manchester United. The France international is closing in on a return after having the cast removed from his foot. Pogba managed just two substitute appearances after injuring his ankle and foot in September. He then had to undergo an operation, which Ole Gunnar Solskjaer claimed was unrelated. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network It has left United desperately short in midfield, with Scott McTominay also a long-term absentee due to knee ligament damage. But the Scotland international has also offered encouragement after having a brace removed from his knee and walking without discomfort. There are still no dates for either to make a comeback, but their recoveries have provided positive news for Solskjaer. “It’s hard to put timescales on long-term injuries because they also need the training before they are injury free and need to be fitter,” said the United manager. “Paul’s had his cast off and Scott took his brace off so at least they can now start doing some work on the grass.” Solskjaer also provided an injury update ahead of Wednesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Manchester City. “It’s just Nemanja (Matic) who has a slight problem,” he added. “He had to come off at half-time (against Tranmere) and has played loads of football, so hopefully we can get him back on the pitch tomorrow. I haven’t seen him.” Standard Sport
