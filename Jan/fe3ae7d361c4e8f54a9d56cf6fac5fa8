Shareholders and operators in the Insurance Sector yesterday lauded the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) for extending the deadline for the recapitalisation of the Insurance and Reinsurance Companies, earlier fixed for June 30, 2020, to Dec. 31, 2020 . It would be recalled that NAICOM had on Monday, in a circular with reference No : NAICOM/ DPR/CIR/25-03/2019 /DECEMBER 30,2019 signed by Mr Pius Agboola, Director, Policy and Regulation, announced the extension of the deadline. Agboola said that the decision for the extension followed a review of the recapitalisation plans submitted by the operators and various levels of the compliance observed.

In his reaction, Mr Boniface Okezie, National Coordinator, Progressive Shareholders Association of Nigeria, commended Mr Sunday Thomas, Acting Commissioner for Insurance, for ensuring the extension. “There was no way the commission could stampede the insurance firms with the recapitalisation, considering the warbling and unstable economy and the not clear policy by the Government. “If the Acting Commissioner continues with this trend, then it will be better for the market; as there is no need to be too rigid because you are regulating, but rather consider the plight of the stakeholders, ” he said . Okezie urged NAICOM to improve on its policy for the sector, for the insurance companies to take their rightful position in the capital market which would in turn make the re-capitalisation seamless.
