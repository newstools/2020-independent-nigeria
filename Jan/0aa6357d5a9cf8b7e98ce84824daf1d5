LAGOS -The Federal Government has stepped up plans to focus on mining and importation of bitumen to reduce capital flight. Arc. Olamilekan Adegbite, Minister of Mines and Steel Development, who disclosed in an exclusive interview with Daily Independent in Lagos, said the government had realised the need for local content, which reduces capital flight and creation of employment opportunities. It would be recalled that Nigeria spent over N300 billion annually on importation of bitumen even as some states have large deposits of bitumen in Nigeria, if processed, can reduce pressure on the local currency and boost the nation’s foreign exchange. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Adegbite described bitumen as one of the major minerals resources available in-country which should begin exploration without further delay. According to him, “Bitumen is something we are working on this year. We have got plenty of bitumen between Ondo and Ogun states and we use a lot of bitumen in the country as well. We use bitumen in the construction of roads; it is also the major ingredient in making your ash pot and other things. “We are trying to develop that by bringing investors. Just like other minerals, we need to establish certain data so that investors will be comfortable. We are focusing more on bitumen this year, and hopefully, more investors will come in and explore the bitumen we have so that Nigeria can stop importing bitumen; it is great potential, and we will get there.” Last year, the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), sought review of the Local Content Act 2010, to include other sectors of the nation’s economy, especially power, construction and information and communications technology (ICT).
