Prices of garri which had maintained a downward trend since 2018, started going up gradually last December, 2019 but became evident in most of the markets during the week. Garri is a staple food made from cassava flakes and commonly found on the menu of Nigerian homes regardless of status. The commodity can be consumed as flakes or ‘eba’ depending on the individual. The commodity was once referred to as the meal for the common man but the situation appeared not to be so again especially with the high rate of inflation which has had a negative multiplier effect on the standard of living. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network With the unfavourable prices at which the commodity is currently going for, consumers were seen lamenting and some of them had no option but to reduce their purchases. Traders were also affected adversely as some of them could no longer sustain their normal purchases because of the multiplier effect it had on their purchasing power. Findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT indicated that prices of the commodity grew by over 30 and 40 percent in few markets between November 2019 and January 16, 2020, of which many of the traders linked majorly on scarcity and closure of surrounding land borders by the Federal Government. During the week, checks at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, revealed that prices of the commodity were at a rising trend especially when compared with what they were initially. For example, a 50kg bag of yellow garri that earlier attracted between N5,500 and N5,800 soared, currently ranging from N7,000 to N7,500 while that of the white garri also grew by 34 percent  to between N6,000 and N6,500 against N4,500 sold previously. Madam Abigail Udeh who sells the commodity at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, connected the hike to seasonal factors. That of Ose Market, was also affected, escalating by over 25 percent, especially with the price of a 50kg bag of yellow garri currently selling for between N6,800 and N7,500 up from N5,000 sold earlier. Likewise, that of the white garri soared with a 50kg bag attracting N6,500 as against N5,000 sold before. Most of the traders at the Ose Market, in a chat with our correspondent blamed the situation to sharp reduction in supply owing to drought. For Oba Market, Benin City, Edo State, the situation was not contrary as prices of the commodity witnessed an upward trend. For instance, a 50kg bag of yellow garri sold previously for between N5,000 and N5,500 went up by over 30 percent, currently selling within the region of  N6,800 and N7,000, depending on the haggling power of the customer. That of the white garri also soared to N6,000 from N4,800 sold formerly. Mr. Obehi Raphael who trades in the commodity at the Oba Market Benin City, connected the hike to off-season effect. At the Dei-Dei Market Abuja, prices of a 50kg bag of yellow garri currently go for between N11,500 and N12,000  as against N8,500 initially sold while that of white garri went for  N10,000 against N7,000 initially sold. Many of the traders attributed the situation to unavailability usually common during dry season. However, Mr. Egbuna Friday, a garri seller at the Dei-Dei Market, Abuja, agreed with the opinions of other traders but specifically blamed the situation on high cost of transporting the commodity from the South. In Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of garri also soared as a 50kg bag of yellow garri went up to between N8,000 and  N8,500 from N7,000 previously sold while that of the white garri escalated to N7,000 from N5,500 sold before. Mr. Ayodele Shina who sells garri at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, linked the hike to scarcity as well as increased patronage. For Bodija Market, Ibadan, prices of garri regardless of the type were at an increasing trend, particularly with prices of a 50kg bag of the yellow garri currently ranging from N8,500 to N9,000 up from between N6,500 and N6,800 previously sold while that of  white garri went for N7,500 against N5,000 previously sold. Many of the traders at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, ascribed the hike to inadequate supply usually associated with the season of lack. The same could be mentioned for Lagos, as visits to popular markets such as Mile 12, Iddo and Oshodi revealed that prices of garri had increased considerably to the dismay of consumers. For instance, a 50kg bag of yellow garri grew sharply to between N9,500 and N10,000 from between N6,500 and N7,500 sold formerly. Likewise, that of white garri currently selling within the region of N8,000 and N8,500 as against between N5,500 and N5,800 sold before, signifying a 46 percent increase. Mr. Ndubuisi John, a trader at the Oshodi Market, blamed the situation to the state of the economy. This is just as Mrs. Maureen Uche, another trader of same market, debunked his claim as she linked the situation to shortfall in supply owing to seasonal factors. Worse hit were consumers who purchased the commodity in smaller measures as prices of a paint bucket measurement previously sold for between N350 and 450 soared greatly, currently selling within the region of  N650 and N800 depending on the location and  bargaining power of the customer.
