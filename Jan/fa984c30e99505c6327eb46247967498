IBADAN – Leaders of the Igbo community in Oyo State have raised an alarm over alleged plan by some individuals to make mockery of the Igbo traditional title by installing different Igbo monarchs on people from Igbo speaking states living in Oyo State. In a statement made available to journalists in Ibadan over the weekend, Igbo leaders in the state insisted on only one Eze Ndigbo in Oyo state in person of Eze (Dr.) Alex C. Anozie, who was democratically elected in 1997. The statement was jointly signed by Chief Mark Nwokocha, Sam Ulelu (Abia state); Chief R. Amuta, Chief Anthony Okparauchu (Anambra); Chief Dominic Ezeani, Chief Joseph Nwigwe (Enugu); Chief Dr. Obiezu, Chief Pascal Ekwetosi (Imo); Chief Odah and Chief Okoro Odey (Ebonyi). They, therefore, warned against the plan by some individuals to “create Eze Ndigbo of Enugu, Eze Ndigbo of Anambra, Eze Ndigbo of Imo, Eze Ndigbo of Abia, Eze Ndigbo of Ebonyi, and others, in Ibadan and the whole of Oyo State.” The Igbo leaders maintained that this would constitute an abomination and proliferation of the exalted tradition and culture of Ndigbo, and would also dangerously divide Igbo people living in the state. They called the attention of those behind the plan to the fact that Igbo leadership position in Ibadan and Oyo State had been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction, and that the judgment had not been vacated by any superior court. According to them, the leadership of Ndigbo in Oyo State is under the umbrella of ICDA/Ohanaeze Oyo State and Eze (Dr.) Alex C. Anozie as the Eze Ndigbo/Onyendu in Ibadan and Oyo State.
