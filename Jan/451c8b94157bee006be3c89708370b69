Juventus are prepared to sell Adrien Rabiot if a club meet his £25m valuation. Arsenal are particularly keen on the French star as they seek a central midfielder in January. Mikel Arteta has made Rabiot his top target this month and the Gunners will be buoyed after having their initial approach rebuffed. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The former PSG midfielder has struggled to establish himself in the starting XI since joining in the summer which may see him seek pastures new, according to reports in Italy . He played consecutive 90-minute games for the first time this season recently as the Bianconeri saw off Sampdoria and Udinese, but they are still prepared to let him leave for the right money. Rabiot won 18 honours with the Parisians during his seven years there and would bring with him a winning mentality. Arsenal though will face competition from Premier League rivals Everton whose manager Carlo Ancelotti worked with Rabiot at PSG. The Gunners’ need for a central midfielder may accelerate further if Granit Xhaka quits the emirates to join Hertha Berlin. It had looked as if the Swiss midfielder would be heading for Germany after falling out of favour with the club’s fans, but Arteta is keen to have him stay. After their 2-0 win over Manchester United on New Year’s Day he said: “I think he’s going to stay. I really like him. The way we want to play, if we get him on board then he can be a tremendous player for the football club. “It’s his commitment, I like the way he focusses, I like the way he lives his profession, he’s willing to learn and he’s a great football player. “It’s also his range of passes and I’m just delighted to have him.” Arsenal are also eyeing defensive reinforcements with their leaky back four continuing to be a problem. Their clean sheet on Wednesday was only their second in the last three months.
