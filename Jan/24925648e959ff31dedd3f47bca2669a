The budget is now a legitimate document designed to put government on its toes, in a bid to bring the desired and much awaited development to the gateway state. “Undoubtedly, the teeming youths of our state will have reasons to smile in this New Year. “This is because of the Sports Commission and Sports Trust Fund laws that were passed on the last legislative day in the year 2019. ”These bills too have gotten the assent of Mr Governor.
