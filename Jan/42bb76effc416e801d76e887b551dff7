LAGOS – Chief Sunny Onuesoke, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday said the Federal Government is wrong by describing the Southwest security outfit codenamed, Operation Amotekun as illegal. He described the Federal Government’s position as unfair and not in tandem with the principle of egalitarianism being preached by the present All Progressive Congress (APC)-led administration. Onuesoke who made this known on the sideline at Ibadan, Oyo State during a security workshop noted that the use of village hunters and vigilante personnel adopted by the security outfit presented the best form of community policing.

Onuesoke argued that it is out of place for the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami to say the machinery setting up Ametokun is unconstitutional when the Civil Defence, Civilian JTF and sharia police that are of similar background and outlook were already in existence. He maintained that the right to preserve and protect one’s life can never be in the exclusive list of any government. “Why do people employ guards in their houses? For security. Why do Community Development Associations (CDAs) employ guards to secure streets and areas? To ensure protection of lives and property. Is that initiative in the exclusive list of the constitution? No,” he argued. He pointed out that the Federal Government is expected to complement the efforts of the South-west governors rather than an outright rejection and condemnation of the security outfit.
