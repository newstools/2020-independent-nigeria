Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quickly corrected himself after calling Israel a “nuclear power” on Sunday. Netanyahu made the comments at a weekly cabinet meeting while briefing ministers about a deal with Greece and Cyprus on a pipeline to ship gas from the eastern Mediterranean to Europe, according to Reuters. “The significance of this project is that we are turning Israel into a nuclear power,” he reportedly said, before correcting himself and saying “energy power.” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Israel is widely believed to have an arsenal of nuclear weapons but has never confirmed or denied it. Netanyahu declared victory in the primary contest for leadership of the Likud party last month. He is seeking reelection in the March general election, which will be the third in the country in less than a year. The elections last April and September were inconclusive. Netanyahu was indicted on corruption charges in November, which he denies.
