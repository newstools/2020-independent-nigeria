The Etiti Technical Secondary School Alumni Association, Afikpo South Local Government Area of Ebonyi State has expressed worry over the rising cases of cultism in secondary schools, saying it was high time the scourge was nipped on the bud. The Association noted that the incidence of cultism in the school had assumed a disturbing dimension as teachers have become accomplices to the nefarious activities of the students. Speaking on Wednesday during its inaugural meeting held at the school premises in Ndi-Iba Village, Etiti Edda Community, President of the Association, Mr Irem Ukpai decried the non-participation of their alma-mater in both the West African Council Examination (WAEC) and the National Examination Council (NECO) examinations for over three years. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network According to Ukpai, the non-participation of the school in both the WAEC and NECO for over three years, if urgently not addressed, was capable of exposing the students to all manners of social vices as a result of idleness. “This is the best way to go and what we have done today is what is being done in other communities and by all other old boys and alumni associations, to save their alma mater. If we sustain this move, in the next few years to come, we shall have saved the school from its current ugly situation. “Security is key for us to achieve success in our push to stem the tide of cultism in this school. We need to collaborate with the Parents Teacher Association, to fight this and beef up security in the school,” Irem said.
