Prices of local rice which had been on steady rise since the closure of surrounding land borders by the Federal Government have not yet declined. The prices have either remained high or increased further, and with prices of the commodity hitting the roof consumers, especially the common folks, have continued to lament. This is because rice is a staple food commonly found on the menu of most Nigerian homes, Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The situation got worse prior to the yuletide as traders capitalised on increased demand to hike the prices of the commodity. But, despite the huge differential between the prices of local and foreign rice, some consumers who have penchant for foreign items still patronised foreign rice. Findings showed that the unfriendly state of the economy coupled with the high rate of inflation had affected patronage level adversely as consumers had to make do with what their purchasing power could afford by reducing their purchases. With this, some traders were also affected especially those that increased  their supplies not taking into cognisance the state of the economy as well as the unfavourable prices at which the commodity were  sold. Visits to some markets across the states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of the commodity remained beyond the reach of the masses especially when compared with that previously sold between August 2019 and January 3, 2020. The reason principally given for the increase was scarcity owing to closure of surrounding land borders. During the week, checks at the Ughelli Main Market, Delta State, indicated that prices of a 50kg bag of local rice sold for between N22,500 and N23,000 before the yuletide remained unchanged. That of foreign rice, although appeared scarce, went for between N27,000 and N30,000 depending on  the brand and bargaining power of the customer. Mr. Solomon Ebuka, who trades in grains at the Ughelli Main Market, Delta State, linked the situation to unavailability. That of Umuahia Main Market, Abia State, was also on the high side, as a 50kg bag of local rice which formerly  attracted between N18,000 and N19,500 soared the more, currently ranging from N21,000 to N22,000 of which many of the traders attributed to inadequate supply and high cost of logistics. For Dawanau Market, Kano, prices of the commodity were at an upward trend especially with a 50kg bag of local rice currently going for between N18,500 and N19,500 as against N17,500 initially sold. But this depends on the quality and haggling power of the customer. That of foreign rice was not favourable either, as its prices ranged from N22,000 to N23,000, up from N15,000 earlier sold. Most of the traders in Dawanau Market, Kano, linked the situation to scarcity arising from border closure. That of Minna Market, Niger State, was relatively high, with a 50kg bag of local rice currently selling for between N15,500 and N16,300 up from N13,500 initially sold. While that of foreign rice attracted between N22,000 and N23,000 up from N13,500 initially sold. Alhaji Maina Subairu, who sells the commodity at the Minna Market, Niger State, blamed the high price to poor supply. This is just as Yaqub, another trader of same market, shared same opinion but specifically blamed the situation on government insensitivity towards the plight of the masses. For Oba Market, Benin City, prices of a 50kg bag of local rice remained stable at between N19,500 and N21,000 while that of foreign  rice went for between N26,000 and N28,000 owing to unavailability. Mrs. Emutan Aigbe, a trader at the Oba Market, Benin City, attributed the situation to sharp cut in supply since the ban of smuggled rice in to the Nigerian market. A visit to Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, showed that prices of both local and foreign rice were beyond reach, a situation which saw consumers lamenting. Prices of local rice remained unchanged ranging from between N18,000 and N19,000 sold previously while that of foreign rice still remained at N25,000 despite proximity to the border. Many of the traders at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, said the hike had affected them adversely especially in the area of maintaining their normal supplies. In Bodija Market, Ibadan, the trend was not different from other locations as prices of the commodity remained high. For example, a 50kg bag of local rice still went for between N19,500 and N21,000, depending on the brand while that of foreign rice stayed put at between N26,000 and N28,000. Mr. Morris Adewunmi, who trades in the commodity at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, connected the situation to increased demand which usually occur whenever there is scarcity. For Lagos, visits to popular markets such as Mile 12, Daleko and Ogba revealed that prices of local and foreign rice still remained unchanged from what they were sold during and after the yuletide. For example, at the Mile 12 and Ogba markets, Lagos, prices of local rice still attracted between N18,500 and N21,000. Likewise, foreign rice, remained stable at between N25,000 and N28,000 but  depends on the market, brand and haggling power of the consumer. Most of the traders in Lagos linked the situation to limited supply and closure of surrounding land borders by the Federal Government to curb smuggling.
