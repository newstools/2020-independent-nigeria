The BBC’s Director General Tony Hall will stand down in the summer, the British broadcaster announced on Monday. In a message to BBC staff announcing his decision, Hall explained he would leave in order to allow a new leadership team to steer the organization through two crucial processes: a mid-term review in 2022 and a charter review in 2027. The BBC is publicly-funded and has its charter renewed every 11 years by the UK government. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “It’s been such a hard decision for me. I love the BBC. I’m passionate about our values and the role we have in our country – and what we do globally too,” wrote Hall. “If I followed my heart I would genuinely never want to leave. However, I believe that an important part of leadership is putting the interests of the organization first.”
