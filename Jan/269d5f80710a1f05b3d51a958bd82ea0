SAFA technical director Neil Tovey has advised the national team on how to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. South Africa were drawn with Ghana, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia in Group G of African qualifying, with matches kicking off in March.  Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “I think one good aspect about it is that we know Ghana, we are playing them in the AFCON,” the former Bafana Bafana captain tells KickOff.com. “So like any draw it’s going to be tough, you’ve just got to perform at home. You’ve got to make sure you win at home and then you’ve got a good chance. “They are all three difficult games. What’s good is that it’s a group where anybody can beat anybody so you know you’ve got to get yourself sorted because other teams will be taking points off each other.  “So you’ve got to make sure that you do what you need to do at home, and that’s why it’s so crucial to do what you need to do at home. You’ve got to do the job, it’s simple.” Tovey says things would have been much easier if Bafana were in the top 10 of the CAF rankings as they would have been seeded. “If you are in the top 10 then it helps and assists you when you are further down the line you know,” he adds.  “So you have to slowly start doing the job in the AFCON and all these competitions so you can come down the rankings, so that when you go to these sort of draws you are in the top drawer. That’s the first job that Bafana has to do.”
