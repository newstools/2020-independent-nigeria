ADO-EKITI – The Planter of Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Adamimogo Outreach, Osun State, Prophet Sam Alo, has warned that God would punish clerics who take delight in deceiving unsuspecting believers. Prophet Alo, who spoke at Joseph Ayo Babalola Christ Apostolic Church, Ikeji-Arakeji, urged Nigerians to pray against plane crashes, not only in Nigeria, but across the globe. He also called on the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) and other Christian bodies to support one another for the sake of unity. While calling on Nigerians to pray for the manifestation of God’s plans for the country in 2020, he disclosed that the year holds bumper harvest for the people, among other eight things. He said: “There is no real law guiding the activities of churches and members of these associations. Nobody is ready to take on or challenge those seen not doing things in godly manner. People are just doing things the way they like. All these must stop. “God said there will be storm in the country for some times, thereafter time of relief and peace will come, therefore, we must seek the face of the Lord. “It is a year of revenge for those troubling our country. We must pray against the death of strong and powerful people in the country, top political leaders, including governors, members of the National Assembly.” He also charged all true men of God to pray against denominational war within Christendom, saying this might be sparked by mixed multitude within the fold.
