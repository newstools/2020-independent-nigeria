President Muhammadu Buhari has insisted that every Nigerian graduate must have a credible school certificate. Elders and of course Nigerian philologists have expressed concern over what they described as ‘semi-literate graduates’ Nigerian universities produce in recent time. Displeased by this notion, Buhari promised to give more attention to improving personnel and infrastructure of universities to produce quality graduates. “The future of the country depends on quality education and our certificates must be credible to inspire confidence,’’ he said. He disclosed this when the leadership of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) led by Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi paid him a visit at the State House. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Buhari assured that education will, henceforth, be a top priority in development goals of the country, stressing that effective and efficient operation of universities will go a long way in improving the economy, especially with focus on science and technology. The President directed the Ministry of Education to put in more effort in ensuring that Nigerian universities are properly funded, with adequate infrastructure and staffing.
