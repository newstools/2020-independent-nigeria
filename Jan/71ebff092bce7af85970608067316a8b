Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira has sent a word of warning to new Manchester United signing Bruno Fernandes about the intensity of the Premier League. Torreira played alongside Fernandes at Sampdoria in 2017 before the latter jetted home to Portugal and put pen to paper with Sporting Lisbon. A year later Torreira moved to Arsenal, and now the duo are set to link back up in the Premier League, but at rival clubs. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Fernandes is currently at Manchester United’s Carrington training base where he is completing his medical. The Portuguese flew in to the UK on Wednesday night, and spent the evening at the Lowry, before arriving at United’s headquarters on Thursday morning. Manchester United have splashed out £46.6million, plus up to £21.2million in add-ons, to make the transfer happen. And Fernandes’ former team-mate Torreira is hoping the midfielder can adapt quickly to life in England. “I really hope he adapts quickly, particularly as the Premier League is so physical and intense as a championship,” Torreira told Sky Sports. “I’m sure he has the right mentality to adapt quickly. Obviously he’s joining a big club in Manchester United so I hope he enjoys the move.” Arsenal and Man United have already played each other twice in the Premier League this season, as well as once in the FA Cup, meaning Fernandes will have to wait until next season to go up against Torreira.
