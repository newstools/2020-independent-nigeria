ABUJA –  Sunday Dare, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development has urged stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State to focus on building cohesive party devoid of past petty calculations that weakened it. He submitted a new year message he sent to APC stakeholders in Oyo, commending ongoing efforts by South West political leaders, Chief Bisi Akande, Asiwaju Bola, Ahmed Tinubu and others to reconcile members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and forge a more united APC, saying the initiative holds a promise to reposition Oyo in the region. He said the APC must focus the bigger picture and avoid distraction. “We must as a party move on from past setbacks and disappointments so that we may affix our eye on a brighter future for the party and the state. Let us heed the calls of our leaders to come together, work together, mobilize and strategize together. “ Powered by RubiQube Ad Network As it is now, we all must take a clear stand. The days for petty calculations are over. You are either in or outside the party. One cannot claim to be inside the party and fail to align with all efforts to resolve the issues that have arisen to affect the operations of our party,” he charged. Dare who maintained that the strength of the APC has never been in doubt in the state declared that stakeholders must work cooperatively to make the party stronger. “We must act with greater cohesion and strength of purpose. We must build on the developmental legacy established by former Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi. Eight years of infrastructural improvement and urban renewal opened up Oyo to a new vista of development and changed the face of the state for the better. “ Oyo today has been placed on the path of modernity. No matter what detractors say, we have a track record of achievement that this state has not before experienced. Instead of being stymied by small differences let us use the progress made to compel us ever forward.”
