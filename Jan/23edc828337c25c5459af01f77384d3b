The Consultant rued that most of the pro-poor initiatives of governments suffer lack of sustainability by successive governments. “The Bank is concerned that we are not doing well enough in the various strata of governance when it comes to maintaining infrastructure; the rural roads and agro- logistic hubs components of RAAMP has to be different. “We therefore like to see for a fact that the equipment, personnel and experience of rural road maintenance agency are in place as part of supporting mechanism for project effectiveness,” Ibrahim said. He corroborated the earlier position of the representative of the Federal Project Management Unit (FPMU), Engr. Bukar Gana, that the “revalidation of re- prioritized roads and agro-logistics hubs alignment would get necessary support for smooth project take off.” Earlier in his welcome remark, the Commissioner assured the Bank of the readiness of the Prince Dapo Abiodun-led government to redefine governance to impact the grassroots. “We are redefining governance to the extent that a bottom-top approach whereby we ask for peoples input is the order of the day. “The old order when government determines what the people want on her own whims and caprices is over,” Oludotun stated.
