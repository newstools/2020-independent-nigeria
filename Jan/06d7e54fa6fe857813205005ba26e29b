The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has stated that investment in infrastructure, including roads, electricity, Information Communication Technology (ICT) and gas is imperative for the country to attain economic diversification. Obaseki, who spoke at the South- South enlightenment engagement forum themed “Maximising non-Oil Export Potentials in the South-South Region for Economic Growth,” said his administration has in the last three years focused on diversifying the economy of Edo State. Speaking to participants at the event in Asaba, Delta State, Obaseki said his administration has worked very hard to create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive, stressing that one of the missing links is financing support and expertise to manage small businesses, which Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM) is bringing on board.

Under the oil palm programme, we approached the World Bank programme called Rural Access and Mobility Projects (RAMP) to develop rural roads for easy evacuation of farm produce for export”. On his part, Delta State Governor, Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa said the engagement forum was a big leap for Delta State and the South-South region as it encourages the region to begin production for exports.
