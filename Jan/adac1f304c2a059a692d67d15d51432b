The bitcoin price got a shot in the arm as news came out last night that the U.S. assassinated Qassem Soleimani, head of the feared and formidable Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). As of this writing, the bitcoin price is up 4.74%, approaching $7,400. It is tempting to take this observation and assume that bitcoin will continue to climb as tensions between the two countries continue to ratchet upwards, according to Forbes report. All of this feeds the narrative that bitcoin is a safe haven asset. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network This may be true, and the price of bitcoin may continue to rise. However, the expected fallout will serve as a defining test of Bitcoin’s presumptive role as “currency of last resort” or the “final port in the storm”. It is hard to overstate the impact of Soleimani’s assassination. While few outside of Iran will mourn his passing, there is no denying the level of power and influence that he held in Iran and around the region as a whole. A veteran of the devastating decade-long Iran-Iraq War in the 1980’s, one which most people outside of the region have likely never heard of, Soleimani grew to become a glorified and almost mythical figure within Iran. By leading the IRGC, he was a central player in virtually every major Iranian action in the region, including defense of the Assad Regime in Syria, securing Iranian influence in Iraq (lest the two countries ever go to war again), or supplying and supporting Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel. Some of his lesser-known activities included backing the Houthi rebels in Yemen and other groups across Afghanistan and Pakistan. Taking out Soleimani was analogous to the U.S. losing a Secretary of Defense or National Security Advisor.
