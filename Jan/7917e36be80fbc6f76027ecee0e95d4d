Boris Johnson suffered the first defeat of his new tenure as Prime Minister today after House of Lords peers voted for the Oates amendment by 270 votes to 229. It took just over a month for the Prime Minister, bolstered by a new majority in the Commons, to encounter his first set back as he tries to wrestle his Brexit bill through both chambers.
