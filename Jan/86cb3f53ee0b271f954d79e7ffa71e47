Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq said that he approved the resuscitation of the state annual sports festival because of his belief in the engagement of the youths to attain their full potentials. The 7th edition of the Festival is ongoing in Ilorin with contingents from across its 16 local governments participating in at least 26 Games that last held in 2005. AbdulRazaq on Wednesday said that the Festival would also help promote talents discovery and sportsmanship. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “The resuscitation of the Festival hinges on the need to invest in the youths and sports. Hitherto, the state hired athletes to represent the state in festivals and we need to invest in ourselves and get the home-grown youths to take part in various sports events (nationwide and internationally),” he said.
