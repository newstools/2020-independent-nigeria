LAGOS – The police in Lagos on Thursday docked Sanda-ciddi Sinole, an 18-year-old butcher, who allegedly threatened to stab a woman with dagger for under-pricing meat. The defendant, Sinole, whose address was not provided, was facing a two-count charge of threat to life and breach of the peace, before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court. He, however, denied the charge. The prosecutor, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Benson Emuerhi, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on December 24, 2019, at 5.00 p.m. at Abattoir Cattle  Market, Oko-Oba, Agege, Lagos. Emuerhi said that the teenager threatened to stab the complainant, one Mrs. Fatimo Abubakar. “The complainant was at the market to buy meat and had an altercation with the defendant while pricing the meat which the butcher was selling; he threatened to kill her,” the prosecutor said. He said the defendant also breached the peace when he obstructed policemen from carrying out their lawful duty. Emuerhi said that the offences contravened Sections 56 and 166 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (revised). The Chief Magistrate, Mrs. Olufunke Sule-Amzat, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N30,000 with two sureties in like sum. Sule-Amzat ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed with evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She thereafter adjourned the case till February 22, for mention.
