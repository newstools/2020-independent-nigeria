AKURE – Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ondo State chapter, has described as false the claim of the state Commis­sioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, that the Governor Olu­warotimi Akeredolu-led administration inherited N230 billion from the im­mediate past administra­tion. A statement by Zadok Akintoye, Director; Me­dia and Publicity of PDP, stated that Ojogo quoted a fictitious figure as the debt left behind by PDP-led gov­ernment in the state while on a local television station programme. Akintoye said Ojogo’s claim, which “echoes the same misinformation credited to the Governor of Ondo State, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, on the state of finances inherited on Feb­ruary 24, 2017, is not only untrue, but a clear misrep­resentation of facts and an attempt to misinform citizens and cast the PDP in bad light.” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He, however, referred to an earlier statement credited to Kayode Akin­made, the Commissioner for Information, during Governor Olusegun Mim­iko-led administration, in which he gave analysis of financial status of the state before exiting. The statement reads in­ter alia, “For the avoidance of any doubt, our admin­istration left about N20 billion in the coffers of the state at its exit on Feb­ruary 2017. This includes N7.37billion in the Current Account; N7.53 billion as Fixed Deposit; N1.2 bil­lion in the MDG Account; $346,000 and 443,000Euro in the Domiciliary Account, including the N825 million Sure-P fund at the Local Government Account!
