Financial experts on Saturday said that the upward review of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was necessary to tame inflation. They spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos, while reacting to the outcome of the first MPC meeting of the year. NAN reports that the MPC, at the end of the two-day meeting, voted to raise the CRR to 27.5 per cent from 22.5 per cent. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The CRR is used to determine the minimum deposit commercial banks must hold in reserves with the CBN rather than lend out. It influences funds available at the bank’s disposal to create loans. With a vote of nine out of 11 members, the committee agreed that the monetary policy rate, which impacts interest rate, should remain at 13.5 per cent, liquidity ratio at 30 per cent and asymmetric corridor at +200 -500 basis point. Commenting on the issue, Prof. Sheriffdeen Tella, Professor of Economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State, told NAN that the increment would reduce liquidity in the system. “The priority of the CBN is to reduce inflation rate below 10 per cent, therefore, the appropriate policy is to reduce liquidity. “The increase in reserve ratio will achieve that objective by reducing money with the banks, affecting their ability to give out credits and it is apparent that other ratios be retained. “The capital market is likely to be beneficiary as investors would shift funds to invest in the market, more so when interest rate is unchanged and inflation rate remains high,” Tella stated. Mr. Sola Oni, the Chief Executive Officer, Sofunix Investment and Communications, said that the increment was a right step in the right direction.
