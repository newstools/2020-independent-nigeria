LAGOS  – Gernot Rohr is not prepared to quit coaching the Super Eagles for now and will gladly continue coaching the team if given the opportunity to do. This is because talks on his contract renewal have been unnecessarily prolonged with no clear cut direction if it would be renewed. The contract will expire this June. Despite the uncertainties over the contract renewal, Rohr in an interview reiterated his desire to continue his job saying that he was convinced he can lead the team to future glory. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Rohr confessed that he would gladly commit to a new contract if offered one right away. However, he revealed that the NFF has continued to drag its feet regarding contract extension plans with a meeting earlier scheduled for January now fixed for next month. In an interview with Girondins33, Rohr said, “I would like to continue.” “I have been there for more than three years and it is long for Nigeria, because rarely can a coach be maintained for that long. “And it was possible because the results were good, that the team has evolved and that we accomplished the mission of rejuvenation. It was planned and we managed to do it with young players including Samuel Kalu and Josh Maja. “We no longer have a big star, because John Obi Mikel retired, Victor Moses also retired for family and age reasons … and even our top scorer, Odion Ighalo, announced his retirement after CAN 2019. “We managed to find a scorer with Victor Osimhen, and other playmakers: we have Samuel Chukweze who plays at Villarreal, Samuel Kalu from Bordeaux who plays very well with us – one of the best every time he plays with Nigeria. So we have a very, very young, promising team.” Rohr was appointed the head coach of the Nigeria senior national football team in August 2016, and by the time his contract expires in the summer, he would have been the longest-serving Super Eagles coach since 1994.
