The governor of Ondo State and chairman of South West Governors Forum, Rotimi Akeredolu, on Thursday announced that recruitment into the region’s joint security outfit, Operation Amotekun, will begin soon. Although he was silent on the take-off date and the modalities, he affirmed that those recruited would be trained by security experts. The governor had announced last week that the idea of establishing a centralised operational command centre in Gbongan had been dropped. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network In his reaction, however, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) advised the governor to ensure transparency and fairness in the recruitment. MURIC Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, in a statement issued on Thursday, said: “There are positive signals emerging from the Amotekun camp. We have seen that the initial haste to form a regional security unit has been reduced. “They are sitting down to map out strategies. At the same time, they are putting together a legal framework to legalise the initiative. These are good steps and they were part of the areas of our initial concern. “What we need to stress is the need for the exercise to be fair, transparent and devoid of religious bias and ethnic witch-hunting. “Muslims will join the security network once there is assurance of fairness and transparency. We therefore call on Muslim youths in the region to start warming up for the recruitment exercise. They should collect forms, fill, submit and wait for further instructions.”
