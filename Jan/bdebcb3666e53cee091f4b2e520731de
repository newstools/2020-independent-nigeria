AKURE – A 70-year-old woman, Mrs. Fehintola Wewe, has been abducted by suspected gunmen in her residence at No 13, Broad Street, Sabomi in Ese Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State. Sources said she was abducted by the gunmen during their raiding of the area around 11 p.m. on Friday, February 3, 2020. Her abductors were said to have carted away valuable items during the raid that was said to have lasted for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, it would be recalled that a monarch from the southern senatorial district, the Orunja of Odigbo, Oba Rufus Akinrinmade, had an encounter with the kidnappers who abducted his wife and two children with his personal driver along Owo/Oba/Ikare-Akoko Road in Akoko South West Local Government Area of the state when the victims were travelling to Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, to see another undergraduate child of the monarch. The abductors demanded N100 million ransom for the release of the victims, but after much plea and negotiations, they reviewed the ransom to N60 million. Eventually, the victims were released after spending some days in the captivity, but it could not be confirmed whether any ransom was paid before they were released. As at the time of filing this report, a source close to Mrs. Wewe’s family said they have not been contacted by her abductors. The source, however, revealed that the incident had been reported at Igbekebo Divisional Police Station and police have visited and assessed the scene of the incident. Chief Superintendent of Police, Femi Joseph, Police Public Relations Officer of the state confirmed the incident. He disclosed that Police had swung into action to effect the rescue of the victim.
