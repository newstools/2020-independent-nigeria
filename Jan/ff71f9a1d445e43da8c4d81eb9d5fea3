Enugu – A non-governmental organization (NGO), Value Projects Initiative, has urged federal and state governments to celebrate exemplary and hardworking youths in order to motivate others. The national coordinator of NGO, Mr. Chukwuma Okenwa, gave the advice on Wednesday while speaking with journalists in Enugu on how to redirect the energy of youths for positive development. Okenwa noted that if government celebrated exemplary and hardworking youths, it would help to redirect their focus to nation building. According to him, youths doing well in academics, business and innovation should be encouraged instead focusing on youths with questionable wealth. “This will go a long way to encourage youths working hard and showing exemplary qualities to further uplift the country’s image in various spheres. “Making a sort of hero out of them will encourage those not doing the right things to emulate positive and good example as well,’’ he said.

He called for a deliberate policy to strengthen youth programmes at the federal and state Ministries of Youth and Sports in order to have a holistic framework for youth development. “Most times, the negative things being done by few Nigerian youths in Diaspora such as crime and vices show little regard to the image and goodwill of the country. This have to be changed,’’ he said. Okenwa, however, called on youths to succeed in 2020 by getting connected to people they look up to (mentors) as well as ensure that they focus on pursuing their dreams and passion.
