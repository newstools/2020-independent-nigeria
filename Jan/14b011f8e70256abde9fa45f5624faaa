Lagos – Donald Ojogo, Commissioner for Information in Ondo State said the state government is not expecting any accolades from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state despite Governor Rotimi Akeredolu’s sterling achievements in the last three years. It will be recalled that PDP had urged the people not to expect any miracle from the state government, saying Akeredolu has failed the people of Ondo state. However, responding in an interview with Daily Independent, Ojogo who said the PDP’s remarks was that of a frustrated minority said having surpassed the records of previous PDP governments in the state, they don’t expect the party to be happy with Governor Akeredolu and clap for him. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “The government that has within three years taken very courageous steps in terms of developmental initiatives that have surpassed the previous years of PDP government that was in place, how would any PDP person commend such? No right-thinking PDP man will clap for this government. That is the truth”. “So if they are not clapping for us, we won’t be angry and we are not even taking it in any negative form. That is the duty of the opposition and if they are not saying that, who will say it? But the truth of the matter is that whoever is saying that is just trying to echo the mindset of the frustrated minority. Whatever they are saying is the voice of the frustrated minority”.
