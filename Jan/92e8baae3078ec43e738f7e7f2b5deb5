Republican Congressman Paul Gosar tweeted a doctored photo of former President Barack Obama appearing to shake hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani with the caption, “The world is a better place without these guys in power.” Mr. Obama and Rouhani never actually met in person. Rouhani still serves as president of Iran. The fake image, which was tweeted from the Arizona representative’s personal Twitter account, shows Mr. Obama smiling broadly while shaking hands with Rouhani in front of the American flag and the flag of Iran during what would appear to be a photo op. The image of Mr. Obama, however, appears to be taken from a 2011 event during which he was actually shaking hands with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in front of the Indian flag. Gosar faced immediate backlash for sharing the doctored image. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “The world would be a better place if elected officials didn’t share photoshopped images and take pride in being ignorant,” Illinois Congressman Sean Casten, a Democrat, said in response on Twitter. “This is irresponsible.” Many people responded to Gosar’s tweet informing him that the image was fake. They also pointed out that Rouhani is still in power, wondering if Gosar had confused the Iranian president for Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian general who was killed by a U.S. airstrike on Friday. Many commenters continued to express doubts the congressman knew the image was fake when he shared it.
