GUSAU – In its efforts to sustain peace and stability in Zamfara State, the state government has appealed to the Federal Government to reconsider its plan to withdraw the mil­itary from some states hit by banditry. Addressing newsmen to in Gusau, the state capital, Commissioner for Secu­rity and Home Affairs, Al­haji Abubakar Dauran, ex­plained that withdrawal of the troops would give anoth­er chance to armed bandits and kidnappers to return for their nefarious activities in the state. “We in Zamfara have al­ready put in place peaceful at­mosphere for the restoration of the lost peace. Therefore, if the military troops working on the fight against insecuri­ty should be withdrawn, both the federal and state govern­ments would not have any rest until peace is restored because the bandits may come back with their drastic activities,” he said.
