LAGOS  – The Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) will soon begin a campaign tagged: #HallofFame and #WallofShame, to recognise efforts of individuals whose activities promote environmental cleanliness in the state, while naming and shaming residents who indulge in reckless waste disposal. LAWMA said this following the arrest and sentencing to community service by a mobile court of some persons caught disposing waste in unauthorised locations in the state. In a press statement by the Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Folashade Kadiri, issued at the weekend, LAWMA reminded residents of Governor Sanwo-Olu’s executive order on zero-tolerance to traffic and environmental infractions, stressing that ignorance of the law should never be an excuse to engage in acts capable of causing harm to the environment and the people.

LAWMA further said that it had embarked on various media advocacy programmes and community sensitisation campaigns across the state, to educate residents on the need to imbibe the culture of effective waste management in their localities. It further appealed to parents to properly guide their children and wards against harmful environmental practices, warning that anyone caught dumping waste indiscriminately under the cover of darkness would be made to face the full wrath of the law, as the LAWMA’s waste policing is effective 24/7 and would not spare any defaulters.
