She further noted that the Act has provided for mandatory beneficial ownership disclosure, adding that it also gives power to the Commission to classify Incorporated Trustees registered under Part C of CAMA as well as introduce new clauses from time to time. To this end, she pleaded with President Buhari to assent to the CAMA Bill as it would re-define how businesses are conducted in Nigeria. According to her, “I must mention that the Commission’s vision of being a world class companies’ registry is yet to be attained. “To attain that status, it is imperative that the Commission’s enabling Law, the Companies and Allied Matters Act which has been passed by the National Assembly is signed into law by Mr. President. “It should be noted that CAMA has been in existence for about 30 years without any significant review. “With development and changes in commercial transactions, the amendment has become inevitable.” She promised to continue with the initiatives which her predecessor had implemented, adding that the Commission would continue to discharge its mandates for businesses to thrive in Nigeria.
