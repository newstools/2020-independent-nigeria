Bayelsa State Governor, Hon Seriake Dickson, has approved the payment of N30,000 new national minimum wage to workers in the state with effect from this month. The governor, who gave the approval Friday night during a meeting with the leadership of organised labour in Yenagoa, directed the state’s financial team to follow through the template set by the National Wages and Income Commission in implementing the new salary level. Describing the state’s workforce as hard-working, the governor in a statement, however stressed the need for the public service to remain apolitical, disciplined and professional in the discharge of its duties. He explained that the meeting was convened to enable the state government and the labour unions to jointly work out the modalities for the payment of the new wage in such a way that Bayelsa would not lag behind in its implementation.

His words, “I made you people a commitment that we are not (in principle) opposed to the payment of the N30,000 new national minimum wage. Today, I have made good that promise. Under normal circumstances, there is nothing we pay our hard-working employees that should be considered too much. “I cannot thank you enough for the support, cooperation, understanding and patriotism you displayed to my administration for the past eight years particularly during the period of the economic recession. My expectation is that the organized Labour will extend this understanding and cooperation to the incoming government.” Source: VANGUARD
