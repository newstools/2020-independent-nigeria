Prices of Guinea corn and millet which witnessed a significant decline in August last year have remained stable and in few markets they dropped further. The situation seemed to have made some lovers of the commodities who had one time switched to alternative staple food owing to the exorbitant prices at which they attracted, changed their minds to continue patronising the commodities. However, in spite of the reduction in prices of the commodities, patronage level had not really picked up according to some of the traders interviewed. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Guinea corn and millet are staple food mostly enjoyed by children and the elderly because of their nutritional values. They can be prepared as pap or solid, depending on the choice of the individual.  Most nursing mothers prepare it as pap for their children. During the week, visits to some markets across the states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT showed that prices of the commodities maintained a stable trend as well as reducing slightly further in few markets between August 2019 and January 10,2020. Reasons principally given for the stability in prices were increased supply, usually associated with season of harvest and low demand since it is a particular category of consumers that patronise the staple food. Lack of purchasing power was also mentioned. Checks at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, revealed that prices of Guinea corn and millet remained at a sliding trend; with a 100kg bag of the commodities reducing further to between N15,000 and N15,300 from N16,000 sold before. Mr. Sam Enebeli who trades in all kinds of grains at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, in a chat with our correspondent, linked the situation to availability which, according to him, had affected prices positively, enabling most traders to sustain their normal purchases. That of Ose Market, Onitsha, was not different either, as a 100kg bag of Guinea corn remained stable at between N15,000 while that of Millet  fell further to N14,500 from N15,000 sold earlier. Many of the traders at the Ose Market, Onitsha, were cheerful about the favourable situation, connecting it to on-season effect. At the Oba Market, Benin City, Edo State, prices of a 100kg bag of Guinea corn and millet dropped the more to N15,000 and N13,700 respectively from N16,000 sold initially. Mallam Abu Saliu, who sells grains at the Oba Market, Benin City, said adequate supply and availability were responsible for the decline in prices. Prices of the commodities appeared to be cheaper in the North due to proximity coupled with the fact that they are the major suppliers since chunk of the commodities emanate from there. For example, at the Wuse Market, Abuja, prices of a 100kg bag of Guinea corn which previously attracted between N12,000 and N12,700 declined further, currently going for between N11,200 and N11,600 depending on the bargaining power of the customer. Likewise, that of Millet, falling within the region of N10,500 and N11,000 down from N12,000 previously sold. Many of the traders at the Wuse Market, Abuja, attributed the situation to seasonal factors and poor sales. For Achau Market, Kaduna, prices of Guinea corn and Millet remained unwaivered at N9,800 and N10,600 respectively, of which most of the traders connected to season of harvest. But one of the traders, Ibrahim Ishaq, at the Achau Market, Kaduna, told our correspondent that the reduction in the prices of both commodities had not translated to sales, a situation which he blamed on the state of the economy. Checks at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, indicated that prices of the commodities were at a sliding trend especially with the prices of a 100kg bag of Guinea corn dropping further to between N13,500 to N14,000 from N15,000 it previously attracted while that of millet witnessed a downward trend of over 5 percent, still selling for N13,000 as against N13,800 sold formerly. Mr. Bello Adewale, who sells grains at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, said the stability in the prices of the commodities was a good one but not translating to good patronage was worrisome. He, however, linked it to lack of money. In Bodija Market, Ibadan, prices of the commodities especially that of millet remained unchanged at N12,500 while that of a 100kg bag of Guinea corn fell further toN13,500 from N14,000 previously sold. Most of the traders at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, ascribed the situation to availability which is usually common in its season of abundance as well as poor demand owing to lack of purchasing power. For Lagos, checks at popular markets such as Mile 12, Iddo and Daleko where the commodities are sold in wholesale prices revealed that patronage level was actually poor despite the sharp reduction in their prices. For example, prices of a 100kg bag of Guinea corn maintained a downward trend, remaining stable at between N13,000 and N13,500 from N14,000 previously sold. While that of a 100kg bag of millet also remained unchanged at between N12,500 and N13,000 down from N13,500 previously attracted. The decline in prices of the commodities also reflected in smaller measures particularly with prices of a paint bucket measurement still going for between N650 and N800 depending on the location and the haggling power of the consumer. Most of the traders in Lagos markets attributed the decline to improved supply and availability, which according to them, determined prices of commodities.
