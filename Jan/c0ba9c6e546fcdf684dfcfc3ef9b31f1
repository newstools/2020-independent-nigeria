The Acting Managing Director of Abuja Property Development Company (APDC) Bldr. Lawal Aliyu Magaji, has said that the company has commenced designs of affordable hostels that when constructed will accommodate mostly corps members undertaking the mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme in Abuja. Magaji who disclosed this when he paid a courtesy visit on Media Trust Limited, publishers of the Daily Trust and other titles, said the company has also submitted a proposal to the minister of the FCT to construct a parking facility at the Idu train station to ease parking challenges at the facility. He said some other complimentary facilities like food court, tire service centre and automated car wash, were part of the plans for the car park.

Before they can stand on their feet it is really difficult for them to source accommodation after they are out of camp.
