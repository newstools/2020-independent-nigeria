Naama Issachar, a U.S.-Israeli woman jailed in Russia on drug charges, has asked for a pardon, Interfax news agency reported, citing a statement by her lawyers. Israel has called on Russia to release Issachar, who was sentenced by a Russian court to seven-and-a-half years in jail for drug offenses in October. The Kremlin said earlier that it was impossible for Issachar to be granted a presidential pardon without her first formally requesting one. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network
