LAGOS – Lagos State government will be meeting with the management of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to discuss issues of compensation for victims of the January 19 pipeline fire in Abule Egba, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said on Saturday. Sanwo-Olu said the government would also be discussing with the corporation on measures to be taken in finding a lasting solution to incidents of pipeline vandalism in the state. The governor disclosed this while sympathising with over 300 displaced victims of the inferno resettled in Igando Emergency Relief Camp in Alimosho by the state government. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network It would be recalled that Sanwo-Olu was on a week-long working visit to the United Kingdom (UK) when the incident occurred. However, his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, led cabinet members and top government officials on a visit to the scene of the fire last Tuesday. The governor said the compensation plan would be extended to those whose properties were razed in the inferno, adding that some of the victims, who rented homes in the area, would also be supported to readjust back to their normal lives. He said: “As a responsible government, we need to go back and have a thorough discussion with NNPC on what kind of lasting solution we are expecting and compensation we can make available for the victims, so that we can resettle them back into their community. “We will also be looking at various forms of affordable accommodation for some of them, who rent homes in the community. “We have taken enumeration and we know the status of each of the displaced families that are clustered in this relief camp. We will work with the records for the compensation and every one of them will be reintegrated back to their community.” Sanwo-Olu described the incident as a “regrettable disaster”, saying the government felt the pain of the innocent victims who bore the losses of the pipeline vandalism. The governor said the state took the step to resettle the victims at the Igando relief camp to ensure they were not left to their fate and in deplorable conditions in their moments of despair. The Igando relief camp was equipped with various amenities, including primary healthcare centre, constant water and electricity.
