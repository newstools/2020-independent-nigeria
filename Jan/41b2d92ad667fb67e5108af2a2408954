If you’re a huge Star Wars fan, there’s really only one reason to stick with your current Disney Plus subscription if you’re looking for new content before The Mandalorian season 2 arrives next fall. That would be the arrival of season 7 of Clone Wars. We knew from previous promotional materials that Clone Wars would be arriving in February, but according to a new Oh My Disney video, we now have an exact date for Clone Wars’ return. February 17, 2020, just under a month and a half from now. The new season of Clone Wars will be shorter than most of the past seasons. Back when Clone Wars was canceled in 2014, most of its seasons were 20-22 episodes. But season 6 was only 13, and now season 7 here is going to be just 12, presumably at the usual 22-minute length. So around four hours of new Clone Wars content. It’s not clear whether or not this is the final season of Clone Wars, but it looks likely. Originally, the plan for Clone Wars was that it ends the minute Revenge of the Sith starts. We know that this new season of Clone Wars will cover the Siege of Mandalore, an event which is interrupted by Order 66 where the Emperor decrees that all Jedi must be exterminated. We could potentially see Obi-Wan and Anakin in the Clone Wars animation style re-enact some Revenge of the Sith moments, but it also stands to reason that we could get some post-Order 66 content with Ahsoka.
