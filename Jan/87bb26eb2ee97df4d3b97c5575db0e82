Nigerians have largely blamed a former minister of power, Babatunde Fashola, for the latest collapse of the national grid. The grid collapsed on Thursday afternoon resulting in power outage in some parts of the country. The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has said it is working to ‘restore and stabilise’ the grid. Fashola, who is now the minister of works and housing, is still being fingered on social media and accused of being responsible for the collapse of the grid despite a new minister of power, Saleh Mamman, in place.
