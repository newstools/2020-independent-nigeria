Anthem chief executive officer Gail Boudreaux Wednesday said the insurer now operates the “fourth largest” Medicare Advantage plan in the country and will add another 150,000 to 200,000 new members in 2020 following a successful sign-up period. Anthem, which operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states, ended 2019 with 1.2 million Medicare Advantage enrollees, which was up 20% from the year before. “We have strong momentum moving into 2020,” Boudreaux said Wednesday. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Health insurers are adding record numbers of seniors to their Medicare Advantage plans, which contract with the federal government to provide the same coverage as traditional Medicare plus extras. The government has allowed health insurers to cover more supplement benefits, which has boosted enrollment across the industry.

The new members in 2019 and fast-growing government business helped Anthem’s earnings soar 120% to $934 million, or $3.62 per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. 2019. Revenue rose 17% to $27.4 billion. PROMOTED Anthem expects growth to continue thanks largely to its improving government business. In its Medicaid business, which contracts with states to provide health benefits to poor Americans, Boudreaux said the company will be operating in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Anthem said Anthem will add more than 300,000 new Medicaid health plan enrollees in 2020. Anthem ended 2019 with nearly 7.3 million Medicaid health plan members, which was up 8% from the year before. Anthem’s 2020 growth will benefit from its acquisition of health plans from Centene, which needed to divest some assets to win regulatory approval of its recently completed acquisition of WellCare Health Plans.
