To counter the fears being raised about the dangers the new network, 5G, poses to users and environment, a new report yesterday said that there are no studies or solid evidence showing that the use of fifth-generation (5G) technology can be detrimental to health as claimed by certain parties. Global System for Mobile Communications Association’s (GSMA) senior director for Research and Sustainability, Dr Jack Rowley said there were 2,900 studies specific on mobile communications done by researchers over the world but none of them could support the claim. “l have been in the industry for 30 years and have seen similar concerns (over health) with the deployment of 2G, 3G and 4G but there is no significant change in personal exposure.

Prior to the GSMA report, some 5G pundits have been contending that the new network generates radiofrequency radiation that can damage DNA and lead to cancer. They also argue that it will cause oxidative damage that can cause premature aging, disrupt cell metabolism and potentially lead to other diseases through the generation of stress proteins The one-day conference was held in conjunction with the 5G demonstration projects recently launched.
