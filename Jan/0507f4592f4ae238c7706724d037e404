A group, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, Igbo socio-cultural group on Monday, urged the South-East Governors to emulate their South-West counterparts on joint security initiatives, saying that the security challenges facing the country currently were beyond a single security arrangement. The reaction of the leadership of the group is coming on the heels of a reported rape and eventual death of a 54-year-old woman last week, in Ugwulangwu community in the Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. The youths, in a statement jointly signed by its President-General, Okechukwu Isigusoro and Secretary-General, Okwu Nnabuike said it was worrisome that neither the South-East Governors nor leaders of the zone have sufficiently reacted to the rape of the woman to death and the death of a five-year-old boy that died after taking a de-wormer in the region.
