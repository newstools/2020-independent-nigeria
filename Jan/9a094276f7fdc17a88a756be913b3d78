Manchester United are preparing a £50m move for Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek, claims the London Evening Standard. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer called on the United board to make signings in the wake of Tuesday’s humilating 3-1 defeat at home to rivals Manchester City. The United head coach wants to sign at least one new central midfielder this month with both Scott McTominay and Paul Pogba sidelined for the foreseeable future. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network United have already been linked with moves for Premier League pair Jack Grealish and James Maddison. Neither Aston Villa nor Leicester, respectively, however, are interested in selling their best players midway through the season. United have now identified Van De Beek, who was heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid in the summer, as a top transfer target.
