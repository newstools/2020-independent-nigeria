A Sino Chino Ltd company operating in Ishiagu, Ivo Council Area of Ebonyi State has been sealed by the State Government. Governor David Umahi, who decried the alleged ne­glect of host communities by the extractive industries, noted that such does not have a place in Ebonyi State under his watch calling on both par­ties to close ranks for the over­all benefits of all concerned. Recalling how foreign com­panies have run roughshod on the people, he said kidney and liver failures are all as a result of the environmental pollution and other health hazards done by most com­panies who, in most cases fail to carry out environmental impact assessment before be­ginning productions. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network For many months, the Ishiagu community has been embroiled in civil disobedi­ence over the refusal of the Chinese firm to sign pact with the host communities. This neocolonialism has subjugated many communities with the natural resources pil­laged leaving them with delete­rious environmental pollution. The crises snowballed and attracted the governor’s atten­tion who, on Thursday sealed the firm and ordered the piqued youths to sheath their swords pending the signing of the agreement which a draft­ing committee has been set up.
