BAUCHI  – The Bauchi State Ministry of Education and Centre for Information Technology, in collaboration with Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD), is to train education administrators in the state on Information Communication Technology (ICT). The Commissioner for Education, Dr. Aliyu Tilde, who made the disclosure on Sunday, said that the partnership was imperative for the Ministry in order to address the inefficiency in paper file communication system. “Computers have been distributed to all the 219 public secondary schools across the state. Nothing can be achieved successfully without Information Communication Technology in the ministry due to the large size of workers.

The state government is planning to build and equip the 219 secondary schools with ICT laboratories, where the students will have access to e-library with embedded textbooks,” he said. The CITAD programme coordinator, Isa Garba, explained that the partnership would improve the productivity of the ministry with effective communication system, adding that the ministry’s ICT and examination directorates have been trained on packages that could enhance their work.
