LAGOS – Brighton & Hove Albion of England defender, Leon Balogun is set for another spell out on the sidelines, after copping another injury in action with his club in Saturday’s FA Cup defeat, and will more of Super Eagles action this year. Balogun was back playing in his first competitive match for The Seagulls since August 27, but it turned into a nightmare for him on both club and personal levels, as his side fell 1-0 at home to Sheffield Wednesday, and he bowed out with a thigh complaint. Having earlier missed all of Brighton’s games in the festive programme due to illness, Balogun’s only previous appearance this season prior to Saturday’s loss was in the Carabao Cup, when his side won away to Bristol Rovers. Sadly, the former Fortuna Dusseldorf, SV Darmstadt and SV Mainz 05 of Germany stopper, who lost his place in the Nigerian national team due to inactivity with Brighton, appears set for another spell out of reckoning, as his now obnoxious injury woes emerge once again. He has only two starts in the Super Eagles’ last 10 matches and looks set to miss the start of the World Cup qualifiers in March, following another blight on the evening he returned to action for his club in the third round of the Emirates FA Cup. Balogun played only the first half of Saturday’s clash against The Owls and was replaced at half time, as The Seagulls reverted to a back-four defensive formation with Aaron Connolly on in place of the injury-prone Germany born central-defender-cum full back. “He is bound to be on a long spell out due to the injury and this might also affect his participation for the Super Eagles,” said our source.
