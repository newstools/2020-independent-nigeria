State media on Thursday reported that the mysterious form of pneumonia that has spread in China’s central metropolis of Wuhan may be caused by a new type of corona virus. The emergence of the virus is raising concerns as hundreds of millions of people are getting ready to travel during the Chinese New Year holiday. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised against a travel ban in China. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks,’’ the WHO said. A group of experts analyzed the gene sequencing of the virus, reaching the preliminary conclusion that it is a new type of corona virus, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The same corona virus has been identified in 15 patients. Corona virus can infect animals and people, causing diseases ranging from the common cold to severe illnesses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Medical authorities in Wuhan reported on Sunday that 59 patients had been diagnosed with the mysterious form of pneumonia, with seven in a critical condition. On Wednesday, eight patients were reported cured and discharged, according to CCTV. The WHO said several patients had worked at or visited the same seafood market in Wuhan when they fell ill in December. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing, and lung lesions. The disease raised alarm in places like Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines, where officials said they would set up quarantine zones or scan passengers from China for signs of the disease. The U.S. Embassy in China issued a health alert instructing travelers to Wuhan to avoid animals, animal markets, uncooked meat and contact with sick people.
