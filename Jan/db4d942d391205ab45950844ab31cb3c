Deandre Arnold, a student who was suspended by his school for not cutting his dreadlocks, has been surprised with $20,000 (N7,250,000) by Ellen DeGeneres and Alicia Keys. Recall that Deandre’s school, Barbers Hill Independent School in Texas, United States, mandated the 18-year-old boy to cut his dreadlocks if he desired to walk in his graduation ceremony. Daily Mail reports that Deandre was invited to Ellen’s show on Wednesday, January 29. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Keys, who was also invited to the show, said she and Ellen spoke to their friends at Shutterfly and they supported Deandre with a check of $20,000 for his schooling. Commenting on what goes on in school, Deandre said: “Every day I would go to school I would always be in dress code. But the thing with them is, if it was let down, I would be out of dress code.” Ellen pleaded with Deandre’s school to have a change of heart, saying the boy deserves to graduate and walk with his mates.
