Ghanaian students in Wuhan in China, are calling on the government to evacuate them from the country because of the outbreak of coronavirus in the country. According to the Wuhan Chapter President of Ghanaian students, Samson Opoku, the city had been completely locked down for eight days and as a result, people have run out of food supplies. “We are 151 students in the city now, and for us, we want evacuation back home to Ghana.
