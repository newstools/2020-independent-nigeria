The Middlesbrough based engineering company engaged with KPL Training to deliver a Mental Health First Aid England program, which enabled a group of its staff to be recognized as mental health first aiders. The training was delivered by mental health expert Kim Porritt who taught the team how to identify a mental illness, what to do when someone is experiencing an episode and where to obtain additional support. The illness’s covered included depression, anxiety, personality disorders, eating disorders, self-harm, psychosis, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The five mental health first aiders are a positive addition to the company’s current wellbeing program which is in place to encourage colleagues to talk about their mental health as they would their physical health. Director Joanne Bell said: “In a male-dominated industry where mental health would normally be a taboo subject, we are raising awareness and breaking the stigma through mental health first aid training. “One in eight men have a common mental health problem and in 2017, 75% of the 5,821 suicides in Great Britain were male. “INDUSTRY is passionate about taking care of both our employees’ physical and mental wellbeing and our next goal is for every one of our 30-strong team to complete a half-day mental health awareness course.” Beyond the formal training, the work culture at INDUSTRY is enhanced by the regular attendance of the directors’ dogs, Maisie and Duke. Studies show that dogs reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, and can trigger workplace interactions and increase productivity. Joanne Bell said: “There is a growing trend of dogs being brought into work and we have found this has supported our focus on mental health, as our team loves having the dogs around, it lifts their spirits and Maisie and Duke benefit from the extra attention too.”
