LAFIA – Shupe community in Obi Local Government Area of Nasarawa State on New Year eve flew out of their homes to neighbouring villages over the death of 23 years old boy who was allegedly murdered by his rival over a girl friend. An eye witness who spoke to Daily Independent on condition of anonymity said the boy was hit with a stick to death by a group of boys alleged to belong to the group of the boyfriend to the girl. According to an eye witness, “A boy was escorting his girlfriend when some boys suspected to belong to a rival group emerged and attacked the boy and killed him on the spot. “But there was retaliation that led to burning of houses in the community. As I am talking to you now, the community has been deserted; some fled to neighbouring villages in the area and others to nearby bush.
