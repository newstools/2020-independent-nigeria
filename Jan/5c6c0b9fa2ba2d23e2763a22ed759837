New Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is looking to sign a box-to-box midfielder this January, according to reports. The Gunners have been looking for a new midfielder ever since Granit Xhaka’s furious clash with fans, which saw him stripped of the captain’s armband. It looked certain that Xhaka was going to leave Arsenal this month, with Hertha Berlin among the teams ready to land the Switzerland international. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Following Unai Emery’s sacking, and Arteta taking the reins, Xhaka has returned to Arsenal’s first-team set-up and has once again become a valuable member of the first team. He is now willing to stay at the Emirates, which is a huge boost for the cash-strapped Gunners, and means they no longer need to sign a replacement. According to The Athletic, Arteta still wants to sign a hardworking midfielder this January as he feels the Gunners are lacking in this area. Arteta was warned he wouldn’t have big money to spend in January when he took the reins. The club had just splashed out £140million in the summer window, and made it clear that they consider June to be a better time to land new recruits. Arteta is therefore looking to make the most of the loan market this month. The Spaniard recently revealed he is looking at new players, alongside the Arsenal board, who all play a part in the club’s transfer business. On how he convinced Xhaka to stay, he said: “The first message for him was that I wanted to understand how he was feeling, why he was feeling that way. “I wanted him to hear from me my opinion on him, and that I was ready to support him and that I was ready to push the club to be supportive of him too, because I thought he could be a really, really good player for us and he could enjoy playing under me in this football club. “I tried to convince him that way. He thought about it, he had a very positive response afterwards, and I think he changed his mind.”
