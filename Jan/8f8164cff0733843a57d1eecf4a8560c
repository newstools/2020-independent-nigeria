ABUJA – Uturu Development Association (UDA) has built and donated a modern office complex worth N15.5million to the Nigeria Police which would serve as the Police Divisional Headquarters in the area. Speaking at the occasion of the official commissioning/hand-over of the building in Uturu, Abia State on Tuesday, the President-General of UDA, Mr Emmanuel Akaeme, said the ultra-modern office complex was built within eight months through the altruistic sacrifices of the members of the Uturu Stakeholders Forum and indigenes. Akaeme explained that the new office which comprises seven well-spaced offices, a counter, cast armoury, male and female cells, spacious work environment, among others, would tremendously assist the personnel of Nigeria Police to perform optimally in the discharge of their duties. He noted that the building of the Police Divisional Headquarters became necessary given the increasing security challenges in the community occasioned by the high pace of developments in the community.
