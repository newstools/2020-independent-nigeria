The
Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu yesterday said that
Methanol Production Technology will cre­ate jobs and wealth in Nigeria. Abdulganiyu Aminu, the ministry’s
spokesman, in a statement in Abuja, said the minister made this known at the
Second Inter-Ministerial meeting of the implementation of the National Policy
on Meth­anol Fuel Production Technol­ogy. “Nigeria’s enormous gas re­sources
will be converted into useful products, through meth­anol technology, thereby
paving the way for other businesses to grow. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “The introduction of meth­anol
technology will go a long way in reducing gas flaring in the environment,” Onu
said. He noted that the demand for gas by
businesses would tremen­dously reduce gas flaring. The minister said that the Federal
Government had in­tended to end gas flaring in Nige­ria, adding that with
methanol technology production a large amount of gas flared would be converted
to methanol. He further said that with methanol
usage of kerosene and firewood to cook would be reduced to the barest minimum
thereby reducing deforestation. “Methanol is a major raw ma­terial
in industrial production and will impact positively on transportation, power
genera­tion and manufacturing. Earlier, the Permanent Sec­retary in
the ministry, Dr Bello Umar, had called on the commit­tee to ensure thorough
work was done toward the immediate im­plementation of the policy. Umar said it
was for the good of the nation and to boost the revenue drive of the Federal
Government.
