The National Youth Council of Nigeria has said that the position of the Federal Government on the Southwest security outfit codenamed, Operation Amotekun, is unfair and not in tandem with the principle of egalitarianism being preached by the present APC-led administration. The National Public Relations Officer of NYCN, Bestman Okereafor, made this known in Enugu on Thursday. Operation Amotekun was inaugurated by the six states in the region on January 9. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Okereafor said the use of village hunters and vigilante personnel adopted by the security outfit presented the best form of community policing. According to him, this grassroots-oriented and bottom-up structured as well as an all-involving security framework, which Amotekun presents, is the ideal policing framework for modern policing to checkmate emerging criminality in rural and remote communities. He said, “Information at our disposal reveals that Federal Government’s position was disclosed by the Minister for Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami, through his special adviser on media, Dr Umar Gwandu, via a statement issued Jan.14 declaring “AMOTEKUN” as illegal. “Nigerian youths consider this position as unfair and not in line with the principle of egalitarianism being preached by the present APC-led administration. “As progressive-minded Nigerian youth leadership, we expect the Federal Government to complement the efforts of the South-west governors rather than an outright rejection and condemnation of the security outfit,’’ he said. Okereafor, however, called on all South-west residents and Nigerian youths at large to remain calm and be peaceful as ever “even as we await the position of the South-west governors and their consultations with the Federal Government on the matter’’.
