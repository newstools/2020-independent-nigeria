Iran launched missiles at U.S.-led forces in Iraq on Wednesday in retaliation for the U.S. drone strike on an Iranian commander whose killing last week stoked fears of a new Middle East war. Iranian state television said Iran had fired 15 missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq in response to Friday’s killing of Qassem Soleimani, a powerful general who was buried around the time of the missile launches. The U.S. military said at least two Iraqi facilities hosting U.S.-led coalition personnel were targeted early Wednesday. Iraq said 22 missiles were fired. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Iranian state television said 80 “American terrorists” had been killed and U.S. helicopters and military equipment damaged. It did not provide evidence of how it obtained that information. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that an assessment of casualties and damage from the strikes was underway. An unnamed U.S. official told CNN there were no initial reports of U.S. casualties.
