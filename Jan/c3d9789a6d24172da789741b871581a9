Love is love and cheating is cheating. Both are two different things, the earlier we realize that loving someone has nothing to do with cheating the better for our hearts because cheating is a choice. So if you want to be happily married be married and love your partner. If not donâ€™t make your partner committed while you fool around.  Powered by RubiQube Ad Network
