Nigerian whizz kid, Adam Idah, with Premier League side Norwich City was the star of their FA Cup as his hat-trick ensured their 4-2 defeat of Preston North End on Saturday, and qualified for the fourth round. Idah, who was born to a Nigerian father, has only seen a minute of Premier League action for Norwich City but on the back of his display at Preston that will soon change. Idah started on Saturday in the FA Cup match at Preston North End and scored his first ever professional hat trick in only his second senior appearance for Norwich City. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The 18-year-old handed the visitors an early lead with his first Norwich goal. Onel Hernandez doubled the advantage for their side before Idah hit a stunning third from 40 yards after a Connor Ripley mistake. The hosts then made it 3-1 after a Billy Bodin goal but Idah extinguished any hopes of a comeback by smashing home his third – and Norwich’s fourth – from the penalty spot. Josh Harrop got another consolation goal for Alex Neil’s men but the day was Idah’s. The Norwich academy graduate can now aim for more minutes for the Canaries, who are bottom of the Premier League. The win sees Norwich go into the hat for Monday’s fourth round draw. Meanwhile Fulham eliminated Aston Villa 2-1. Aaron Wilbraham was the hero at the grand age of 40 as English third tier side Rochdale took Premier League Newcastle to an FA Cup third-round replay with a deserved 1-1 draw. The veteran striker made the most of some fine work down the right by 17-year-old defender Luke Matheson and smashed home from close range with 10 minutes to play.
