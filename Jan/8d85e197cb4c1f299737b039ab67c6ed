Turkey’s parliament passed a bill Jan. 2 to deploy troops to Libya in support of the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, headed by Fayez al-Sarraj, in the battle against the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Gen. Khalifa Hifter. Egypt and many other countries, including the United States, reacted negatively. In an interview with CNN Turk on Jan.5, Turkish President Erdogan announced that Turkish soldiers will gradually start heading to Libya. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network In a Jan. 2 statement, Egypt’s Foreign Ministry condemned the Turkish parliament’s decision and called on the international community to “handle its responsibilities immediately facing this development.” Cairo had embarked in December 2019 on diplomatic action to mobilize the Arab and international community against the expected Turkish military intervention in Tripoli in northwest Libya. After Egypt called for an Arab League emergency meeting, the league announced Dec. 31 it would reject “any kind” of foreign intervention in Libyan affairs and underlined the need to halt the military conflict.
