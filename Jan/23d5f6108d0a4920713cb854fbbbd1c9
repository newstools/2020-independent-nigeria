Lionel Messi was involved in a heated exchange with Atletico Madrid’s youngster Joao Felix as Barcelona was knocked out of the Spanish Super Cup Thursday. Messi, who won his sixth Ballon d’Or last year, came face to face with the youngster as tensions almost boiled over between the two semifinalists.
Portuguese sensation Felix, compared by some to his compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo, had initially clashed with Barca defender Jordi Alba moments before the half-time whistle, appearing to slap away a finger pointed in his face.
Messi was in no mood to let this slide and waited for the 20-year-old as the players began to walk off the pitch.
The Barcelona captain stood in the way of Felix as the pair continued to argue, needing players from both teams to separate them.
Ultimately, it was Felix who got the last laugh as his side scored two late goals and progress to Sunday’s final against city rivals Real Madrid.
