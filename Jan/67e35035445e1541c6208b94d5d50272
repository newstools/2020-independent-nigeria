Australians are bracing for a dangerous and unpredictable night as bushfires are expected to worsen. New South Wales (NSW) fire commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons has warned of “volatile” conditions that could intensify the fires. Hundreds of fires burned on Saturday, damaging power lines and cutting out electricity in thousands of homes. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Since September, fires in Australia have killed at least 23 people. Dozens of people are missing and some 1,500 homes have already been lost this fire season. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced 3,000 reserve troops will be deployed to help tackle raging bushfires across the country. He has been criticised for posting an advert on Twitter showing how the government is responding to the crisis, accompanied by an upbeat backing track.It follows a hostile reaction from Australians who accuse him of not responding to the bushfire crisis appropriately. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said it was “very volatile situation” and “we are yet to hit the worst of it”. “We are discouraging people from moving from where they are, given the serious threats and the fact that we have so many fires at an emergency level,” she was quoted by ABC as saying. Some fire crews have been pulled out of the Snowy Mountains in the state of Victoria due to worsening conditions, The Guardian reports.
