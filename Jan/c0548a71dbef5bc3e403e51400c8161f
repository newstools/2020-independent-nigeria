Oil prices rose for a second day yesterday, standing on firmer ground after a five-day fall on talk that Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could extend oil cuts if China’s Coronavirus hurts demand, while data showing a decline in U.S. stockpiles helped steady prices. Brent crude rose 33 cents, or 0.6 per cent, to $59.84 a barrel while U.S. crude was up 31 cents, or 0.6 per cent, at $53.79 a barrel. Financial markets that have been hit by the spread of the virus and a growing death toll are taking stock of the economic fallout, helped by comments from the head of the World Health Organisation, WHO, supporting China’s efforts to beat the outbreak.

The OPEC wants to extend oil production cuts until at least June from March, and may deepen the reductions should demand for oil in China be significantly reduced by the spread of the virus, OPEC sources said. U.S. oil inventories fell last week, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday, compared with analysts’ expectations of a gain of 482,000 barrels. It would be recalled that Saudi Arabia, de-facto leader of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, sought to calm market jitters on Monday – urging caution against gloomy expectations on the impact of the virus on the global economy and oil demand.
