The task of making the Nigerian Postal Services profitable is one that must be accomplished. This was the charge on Thursday to the staff of the organisation by its Postmaster General, Dr. Ismail Adebayo Adewusi. Adewusi, who led other top management staff of NIPOST on facility tour of the organization in Lagos, said President Muhammadu Buhari has mandated the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy to raise NIPOST to global standards in delivering quality services to its customers. Facilities inspected on the first day of the tour which would run for two days include the International Mail Processing Centre, NAHCO Centre at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport Ikeja, Post Office Oshodi, General Post Office, Marina, Philately Department, NIPOST Lafiaji, and the NIPOST courier services regulatory centre, Lagos Island. In company with the NIPOST CEO was the Chief Operating Officer, Mrs. Nwakanma Loreto. Adewusi said it would amount to self-delusion to pretend there are no challenges facing the organisation adding that it’s only in facing those challenges that they would be surmounted. He said he was in Lagos to get first-hand information on the state of the infrastructure and the operations of the company with a view to delivering on the mandate he has to breathe life into the organisation. “President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami have expressed their readiness to support us in order to attain the status of a world class service delivery company. ‘This is because NIPOST has great roles to play in the realization of a digital economy.” “We want to be able to operate at the same wave length with any other internationally recognised service company.” Saying operations in Lagos is very key to the overall success of the courier and logistics company, the Postmaster General said “if we get it right here, it means we will get it right everywhere.”
