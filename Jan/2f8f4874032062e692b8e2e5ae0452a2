Mike Bloomberg’s rapidly expanding presidential campaign is moving to Times Square, setting up its headquarters at the old New York Times building on West 43rd Street. The relocation — from the building that historically housed Bloomberg Philanthropies — comes as the billionaire and former New York mayor’s campaign pushes past 300 staffers at his headquarters and more than 200 more now active in the states, officials confirmed. Bloomberg’s new offices, first reported by POLITICO and part of an email he planned to share with staffers Monday, includes an open layout with a desk out in the open for Bloomberg, a move in keeping with his ethos as a businessman and mayor.

Rooms and conference spaces will be named after states and include the number of delegates each state sends to the Democratic National Convention. Bloomberg also made some operational news by saying how he would run his White House. He’d turn the historically guarded East Room into an open office environment — “where I’ll sit side by side with our team.” And he’d use the Oval Office for some official functions — “never for tweeting” — but added: “The rest of the time, I’ll be where a leader should be: With the team.”
