Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has described the death of Dr AbdulKadir Oniyangi as the end of an era, saying the contributions of the frontline medical doctor to the development of Kwara State are well documented for history. “His Excellency commiserates with the entire Oniyangi family of Ilorin on the death of the elder statesman. Mr Governor reckons that Dr Oniyangi was a trailblazer in the public health sector in not just Kwara State but in the entire northern Nigeria. He was in fact one of the first medical doctors in the entire northern Nigeria,” according to a statement by Chief Press Secretary to the Governor Rafiu Ajakaye. “Dr Oniyangi, former Head of Service and Secretary to the Military Government in Kwara State between 1984 and 1985, was also a distinguished public administrator who served the state and Nigeria meritoriously. His tenure as the President of the Ilorin Emirate Descendants Progressive Union (IEDPU) was very outstanding.” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network
