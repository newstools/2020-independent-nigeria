A woman has to undergo surgery on her oversized big toe after it’s revealed she has two digits growing in one. Dr. Brad Schaeffer, a New Jersey-based podiatrist, removes the extra bone in his patient Kiara’s big toe on Thursday night’s episode of the TLC reality series My Feet Are Killing Me. ‘Kiara’s a really interesting case,’ the foot and ankle surgeon explains in a preview clip. ‘She has a really big toe. Her body, for whatever reason, wanted to grow another toe on the inside of her foot.’ Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Dr. Schaeffer says the goal of the surgery to give Kiara a ‘perfect mirror image of her right toe.’ In the operating room, Dr. Schaeffer is joined by fellow podiatrist Dr. Sarah Haller, who gushes that working with him is ‘awesome.’ ‘You know he is actually trying to help,’ she says. ‘He’s going to do whatever he can to make his patient’s life better. Dr. Schaeffer begins the procedure by making an incision right down the middle of her toe and removing the nail. ‘Can you feel bone under there?’ Dr. Haller asks as he cuts into his patient’s toe. ‘It’s bigger than I thought it was going to be.’ Although he can feel the bone with his scalpel, he has trouble removing it at first. ‘You know, when looking at an X-ray, it looks like there is a clear demarcation where there’s like a nice joint,’ he explains, ‘but that bone is attached in a certain way to where I just can’t get through it with a blade.’ Dr. Schaeffer ends up needing to switch tools in order to fully remove the piece of bone that was growing in Kiara’s big toe.
