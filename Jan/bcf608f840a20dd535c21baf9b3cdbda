Lagos – Nigeria’s female national team, Super Falcons’ former top striker, Mercy Akide-Udoh has been tipped alongside two other ex-internationals as ladies who are capable of taking over as head coach of the nine-time African champions. With Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) in search for a new coach following the unceremonious exit of Sweden’s Thomas Dennerby and the failure of Chris Danjuma to qualify the squad for this year’s Olympic Games, a former handler of the side, Ismaila Mabo said Akide and others have what it takes to save the team. Mabo is also rooting for the likes of former goalkeeper, Ann Chiejine-Agunmanu and ex-midfielder Rita Chikweulu as good candidates for the job, alongside Akide, who was on the cards of Stars Soccer Club of USA from 2006 to 2008. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Mercy Akide is there, Ann Agumanu is there, Nwadike is there, so many of them are there and they are well trained coaches. I believe our girls can do it. I have confidence in every one of them that I have mentioned. “Our girls should have their destinies in their hands. Mabo as an authority in women’s football is saying we have capable hands and I have mentioned their names. If it’s a must they bring a male coach, then they should bring those who have been doing it, especially with their clubs,” he said. It would be recalled that before now, two ex-internationals in persons of Uche Eucharia and Florence Omagbemi have handled the team. Omagbemi was hastily removed after appearing to lead a players’ mutiny, few years after Eucharia faced similar fate. Eucharia won the 2010 African Women’s Cup of Nations with the Super Falcons and led them to the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup, while Omagbemi took the side to the 2016 AWCON in Cameroon, after which she was replaced by Thomas Dennerby.
