Philosopher Roger Scruton, one of Britain’s most prominent conservative thinkers, has died aged 75. Scruton’s family said in a statement that he died on Sunday after a six-month battle with cancer. A graduate of Cambridge University and a long-time lecturer at the University of London’s Birkbeck College, Scruton carved out a role as a public intellectual – a relatively rare thing in Britain – with more than 50 books on morality, politics, culture and aesthetics and regular television appearances. He was widely respected in eastern Europe for his support for dissidents during Communist rule.

In 1999 the Pet Shop Boys won a libel suit against him when he alleged in a book on pop culture that their songs were mostly the work of sound engineers. In 2018 he was hired by Britain’s Conservative government as an adviser on improving the modern architecture. He was fired several months later after the left-of-center New Statesman magazine published an interview in which Scruton said Chinese authorities were “creating robots of their own people,” disparaged billionaire philanthropist George Soros and called Islamophobia “a word invented to stop discussion of a major issue”.
