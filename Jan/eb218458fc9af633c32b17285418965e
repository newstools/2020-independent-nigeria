Powered by RubiQube Ad Network According to him, “Chief Akande is a worthy mentor to the new generation whom he (Akande) considers the strength and hope of the Nigeria that he is toiling for. He added that “In a nation where his fellow octogenarians have retired from public service to the waiting arms of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Baba Akande still burns the midnight oil to brainstorm on the future of Nigeria, armed with his high mental acumen and disarming smile.” The governor further said: “It is obvious that God has been gracious to Baba Akande to be super active in old age because there is so much work to be done. We cannot thank God enough for His mercy and graciousness. “Baba Akande is a detribalised Nigerian who sees the country’s linguistic, ethnic and religious diversity as the nation’s greatest strength where Fifth Columnists capitalise on to tear the nation apart. And he is never tired to mend the fences broken by political pretenders, never tired to offer his voice of reason. “Baba, we thank you for your service and sacrifice for the State of Osun and its people and Nigeria. As progressives and sons and your friends, we are all products of your enduring service and achievements. “As you turn 81, I pray that Allah will continue to grant you the will and ability to continue with the good works you have been doing for humanity.”
