Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reportedly told the Manchester United board he wants six new signings in order to turn things around. The Red Devils are on a shocking run of form and lost 2-0 at home to Burnley last time out, just days after losing to bitter rivals Liverpool. Man United manager Solskjaer is under intense pressure to get the Old Trafford giants firing, with his job now firmly on the line. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The Norwegian is keen to strengthen his side this January, and United have been linked to a whole host of players, most notably Bruno Fernandes and Jude Bellingham. Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish, Leicester City’s James Maddison and Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho have also been discussed as United targets. According to the The Times, Solskjaer has informed the United board he needs six new players to turn the sinking ship around at Old Trafford. Solskjaer has his eye on a full-back, two central midfielders, a number 10, a winger and a forward to lead his depleted front line. The report adds that the United board has vowed to back Solskjaer and will give him the money required to sort things out this season. Man United’s biggest problem this January has been trying to sign players for a fair price. The Red Devils’ move for Fernandes appears to have collapsed for this very reason, with Sporting pricing United out of a deal. United wanted to pay no more than £50million up front for the Portugal international, with Sporting looking for a fee closer to £70million.
