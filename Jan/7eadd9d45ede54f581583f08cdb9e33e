Following the directive of Ebonyi State governor, Da­vid Umahi, on Wednesday that all illegal gas stations be sealed, the state govern­ment on Thursday sealed over 15 of such gas stations in the state capital. The order was enforced by a taskforce set up by the state government to that effect. Members of the task force included the Commissioner for Internal Security, Stan­ley Okoro Emegha; Special Adviser on Petroleum, Basil Chima, and members of the Abakaliki Capital Territo­ry Developmental Board (ACTDB.) Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Mr Chima in his remarks during the exercise, said the state government mapped out land for gas stations, but the operators had refused to move to the sight. He explained that only one station in the city had all the approvals and licences to op­erate in the state. Also speaking, chairman of ACTDB, Uche Onwe, said the state government could not afford to seat and watch the state destroyed by care­lessness of the operators who had continued to build the stations close to residen­tial areas.
