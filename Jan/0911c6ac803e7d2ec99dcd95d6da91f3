YENAGOA – Bayelsa State will benefit from the second phase of the State Employment and Expenditure for Results (SEEFOR) Project funded by the World Bank and the European Union. Greg Onu, the national coordinator of SEEFOR Project, Ministry of Budget and National Planning, Abuja, stated this on Wednesday during a press briefing at the Bayelsa SEEFOR Project office in Yenagoa. He explained that Bayelsa SEEFOR qualified for phase two of the development intervention-scheme after surpassing the targets set for youth employment and public works in the implementation of the programme since it started in 2013. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Onu noted that the state had constructed 402 concrete roads in communities as against its target of 137 and had employed 17,685 youths above the 16,000 targets for youth employment during the period. According to him, the 402 concrete roads were mainly targeted at schools, health facilities and markets which translate to over 70km of roads constructed through direct labour. He stressed that Bayelsa SEEFOR was also “making serious progress in component “B” of the project which is public financial management reforms.”
