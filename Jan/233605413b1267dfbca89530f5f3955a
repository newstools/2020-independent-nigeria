Paul Pogba was among the Manchester United players to attend the club’s Carrington training ground on Friday morning. The United midfielder hasn’t been in action since the Boxing Day victory over Newcastle, after it was confirmed he needed surgery on the problematic ankle injury that has limited his game time this season. Having now successfully gone under the knife, Pogba is focused on rebuilding his fitness and that process is continuing at United’s training complex. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Pogba’s agent Mino Raiola recently told reporters the French midfielder was concentrating on getting fit again, with the player’s camp expected to sit down with United to discuss his future at the end of the season. Pogba, along with Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay, is among United’s long-term absentees at the moment and their absence has been harshly felt. United’s midweek defeat to Burnley and other losses against Arsenal, Man City and Liverpool this month have piled the pressure on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. Some supporters have directed their anger at Solskjaer, although many are unhappy with Ed Woodward and the Glazers. But the Norwegian retains the support of the United hierarchy and is preparing his depleted squad for the trip to Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup on Sunday. Victor Lindelof — who was pictured by MEN photographers driving Pogba into training — is fit again after illness, Solskjaer confirmed in his latest press conference. Eric Bailly and Timothy Fosu-Mensah could both play a part too, having recovered from long-term knee injuries. They were also pictured by photographers going into training — as was Rashford. McTominay and Axel Tuanzebe, who is also out with injury, were not spotted as they continue their own rehabilitation programmes.
