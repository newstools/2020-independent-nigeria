The City of Cape Town’s Disaster Risk Management Centre is dealing with a number of weather-related matters as gusty winds of up to 60 km per hour have been experienced across the Cape since Friday. Roofs have been damaged by strong winds in Fresnaye, Bo Kaap, Bonteheuwel, Bokmakierie, Macassar, Philippi, and Sea Point.The City’s Head of Disaster Risk Management, Charlotte Powell, says no injuries or deaths have been reported. “Storm-related electricity disruptions are being experienced in Pinelands, Bridgetown, Wynberg, Parow, Richmond Estate. Large trees have been uprooted in Gordon’s Bay, Newlands, Mowbray, Rylands, and Bonteheuwel. No deaths or injuries have been reported. City Powered by RubiQube Ad Network departments are assisting the affected communities,” says Powell.Meanwhile, the Cape Winelands District Municipality Fire Services says windy conditions are hampering firefighting efforts to contain a veld fire in the mountains above McGregor. This as mopping up operations continues in the Southern Cape where a veld fire claimed several structures and animals in the Gouritzmond area.At present, there is no threat to other structures. The fire started in the Overberg town of Greyton last week and was fanned by hot, windy conditions that allowed it to spread into the Winelands area over the weekend. Municipality spokesperson Joanne Otto says firefighters are currently managing two fire lines. “The fireline on the La Chasseur side was mostly contained by last night after the combined efforts of aerial and ground teams. A ground team will stay in the area to perform mopping up and monitoring activities today. The fire line in the Kloof, known as ‘die Galg’, is currently between five and six kilometers long. The fire services have deployed six fire fighting vehicles and two fresh ground teams to manage the fire line,” says Otto.Fire authorities say firefighting teams will remain on high alert.
