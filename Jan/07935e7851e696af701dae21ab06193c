The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has attacked the governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu SAN over an alleged plot to eliminate Muslims in the state. A peaceful demonstration by Muslims was also foiled by heavily armed policemen drafted to the town yesterday, Monday, 6th January 2020. It was learned that properties belonging to the Ansar-Ud-Deen (AUD) Primary School in Oke-Agbe, Akoko in Ondo State was forcefully packed out of the school. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network This was disclosed by the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) in a press statement sent to DAILY POST on Tuesday, 7th January 2020. The human rights organization Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola described the action of the Ondo State government as arbitrary, intolerant and provocative. MURIC described plans by Akeredolu to evict and take over the land of Ansar-Ud-Deen school as a plot to eliminate Islam and Islamic education from Ondo State. The Islamic group accused Akeredolu of being intolerant to Muslims, therefore ascribing religious tolerance in Yorubaland as a myth and mirage. The statement reads: “MURIC received an S.O.S. from the Muslim community of Oke-Agbe Akoko yesterday. The whole town was taken over by heavily armed policemen. Properties belonging to the Ansar-Ud-Deen (AUD) Primary School were forcefully packed out of the school. We strongly condemn this action. It is arbitrary, intolerant and provocative. “We urge the Commissioner of Police and the heads of other security agencies in the state to give adequate protection to all Muslims in Ondo State, both indigenes, and non-indigenes, as we have no confidence in the interest of the state government to protect the lives and properties of anyone who is not a Christian in his state.”
