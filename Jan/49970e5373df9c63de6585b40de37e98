ADO-EKITI  – Former member of the House of Representatives, Bimbo Daramola (alias congressman), has again cautioned African leaders against trivialising issues bordering Black on Black violence. Daramola, convener of OneUnitedAfrica/EndXeniphobia Initiative, spoke on the heels of the renewed Black on Black hostilities in some part of the African continent. The Ekiti-born former parliamentarian said all excuses being given for the outbreak of xenophobia in the continent are no longer tenable, calling on stakeholders to rise to the occasion. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network If not wholistically tackled, the former federal legislator warned that the consequences of the renewed hostility could be worse than the infamous fire in Soweto. He said: “It will be nice to know which of the excuses now fits into this scenario, not about South Africans and Nigerians now, not a migration issue, not limited opportunities scenario too. “We have believable and credible reports saying of other manifest situations going on in some other nations in Africa. “Well this again tends to further convey to sceptics that we have an issue in our plate on this continent.” “What did we do corporately to put this matter on front burner? Nothing. Diplomatic and bilateral interventions and that was it,” he asked. “Only tonight, I just got this information from a source and I Googled it, and it turned out true! Though a spin is being created to douse it, the fact is still sticking out. “That an African of the stature of Yvonne Chaka Chaka had to be deported from anywhere on the African continent for not committing any crime,” Daramola lamented. Speaking further, Daramola recalled that “Africa’s own Nobel laureate of Nigerian extraction and a global citizen also went through a near similar experience. But of course, a ridiculous explanation on visa type had to be given in both cases. So where does this take Africa to?”
