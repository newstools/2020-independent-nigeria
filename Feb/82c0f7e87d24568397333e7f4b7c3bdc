In a shocking incident, a woman schoolteacher was tied with rope and dragged along a muddy road in the Indian state of West Bengal. Smrikona Das, a teacher in a school in Fata Nagar village, was told that a road project was being laid in the village and a small part of her land would be utilized. She initially agreed to the deal. But when the contractor during the laying process said she would lose a bit more of her land for the road project, she objected to the deal. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A verbal argument broke out, leading some men to tie her up and drag her along a country road. Hearing the noisy argument and noticing what was being done to Smrikona, her sister intervened. Some men pinned her down too. A video was obtained by Gulf Today that showed a ruling Trinamool Congress panchayat leader egging on the men, rather than solving the issue. The man in the video was identified as TMC panchayat leader Amal Sarkar. TMC district chief Arpita Ghosh called for the suspension of Amal Sarkar from his office. Twitterati reacted with anger over the horrific incident. Keya Ghosh wrote on Twitter, “This is how women get treated in @MamataOfficial’s Bengal. Where are those human rights activists & feminists hiding now?” Ramesh P Shah said, “Can’t imagine this inhuman act can happen in a State whose CM is a woman. Where are these so-called human rights activists? If that had happened in a BJP-ruled state dozens of HR activists, so-called secular parties would have descended like vultures.” Another wrote, “BJP, @narendramodi,@AmitShah would get Votes next Election by showing these Videos of women and also Dead Bodies of BJP Workers who have been murdered by TMC Goons bcoz at d moment they r unable 2stop this.” Ashok Siddula said, “Mamata Banerjee madam speaks more do nothing… she speaks like Imran.” The police have launched an investigation into the incident. Two people have been arrested, though Amal Sarkar is at large.
