LAGOS – Sports minister, Sunday Dare, has again thrown his full weight behind the board of Athletic Federation of Nigeria (AFN), led by Honourable George Olamide, as he said that he can only work with a duly recognized group that has the majority of members. He hinted that he is aware of another faction fronting as the authentic board of the AFN, but he reasoned that it would be wrong to support only two members against 10, hence his unequivocal declaration that the federal ministry of sports is fully behind Olamide’s group. He went on to state categorically that the ministry will not work with the AFN’s suspended president, Alhaji Ibrahim Gusau, who no longer holds a quorum in the track and field body, which is in contrast with the relevance now accorded Olamide, who Dare said he will partner effectively to ensure all-round improvements and better welfare for the nation’s athletes. “The case of the AFN is quite clear. It’s about the majority getting deserved recognition. We recognize the Olamide group, because a 10-member board has more credibility than that with only two members. “As we are doing for every other association under us, we are giving due recognition to the majority, which is the right way to go about such issues. We are ready to intervene without interfering,” Dare said. It would be recalled that Gusau was in November suspended from office, due to alleged disobedience and refusal to act on instruction by the former Minister of Youth and Sports, Barrister Solomon Dalung to relieve Sunday Adeleye, former AFN Technical Director, of his duties. Gusau was also accused of mismanaging $135, 000 grant mistakenly sent to the AFN by global body for track and field, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), now World Athletics, as well as a case of unaccounted $150, 000, for which the acting president, Olamide, recently set up a panel to investigate the ‘missing’ money.
