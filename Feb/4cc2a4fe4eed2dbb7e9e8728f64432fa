UYO – A mysterious rain on Monday morning pulled down a make-shift structure erected in preparation for the funeral of the Akwa Ibom State Governor’s father, Late Emmanuel Gabriel Nkanang, scheduled for February 15, 2020. The structure which was recently constructed to accommodate dignitaries expected to grace the burial of the 90-year-old patriarch was completely scattered by the rain which concentrated within the governor’s immediate community. A member of the community who declined to have his name in print told newsmen that he had suspected some mysterious sabotage and had earlier cautioned planners of the event to engage the services of rain-makers. “How do you explain a rain that circulated within a particular area? I had told the planners of this burial that not everyone would be happy to see a successful burial of the governor’s father. “I earlier suggested the need to engage a traditional rain-maker so that in a situation like this, such mysterious rain would have been diverted to nearby communities,” he said. It would be recalled that this would not be the first time a mysterious rain is reported in the state. Last year similar incident was reported at a particular location in Ukanafun, presumably to obstruct an ongoing construction work. Meanwhile, many have however seen a positive side to the disappointing incident, as they opined that it might have prevented the state from recording another disaster after the 2016 Reigners Bible Church Collapse, as they suspect the make-shift structure might have been constructed with sub-standard materials.
