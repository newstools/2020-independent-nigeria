Reasons principally mentioned for the decline was increased supply arising from seasonal factors and availability. Checks at the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, indicated that prices of a 100kg bag of brown and white beans reduced to between N19,000 and N 20,000 from N22,000 sold before.

That of white beans also dropped to N19,000  from N20,000 initially sold. Many of the traders at the market attributed the drop to improved supply usually common in the season of plenty. For Achau Market, Kaduna, prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans that previously attracted between N18,500 and N19,000 dropped, currently  ranging from N16,800 to N17,500 representing a 10 percent reduction.

For Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, the trend was similar as prices of beans regardless of the species witnessed a decline. For example, a 100kg bag of brown beans that previously attracted between N22,000 and N23,000  currently go for between N19,500 and N20,000, a  12 or 13 percent reduction.

For instance, a 100kg bag of brown beans fell within the region of N18,000 and N23,000  as against between  N20,000 and N25,000 sold before. That of the white species also declined to between N17,500 and N19,000 from N20,000 previously sold. Mr. Ayotunde Ismail, who trades in all kinds o grains at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, said the decrease had enabled him to up his supplies, connecting it to seasonal factors and availability. In Lagos, visits to popular markets such as Mile 12, Daleko and Iddo where the commodity is sold at a wholesale or reduced price indicated that prices of beans were at a sliding trend. For example, prices of a 100kg bag of brown beans currently go for between N19,500 and N22,000 down from  between N22,500 and N24,000  previously attracted while that of white beans reduced to N19,000 from N22,000 sold formerly.

The decline in the prices of the commodity also reflected in the purchases of consumers who buy in smaller measures. For instance, prices of a paint bucket measurement of beans previously sold for between N900 and N1000 currently sells for between N750 and N900 depending on the market.
