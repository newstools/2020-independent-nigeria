NNEWI  – Professor Kingsley Muoghalu, former Deputy Governor of the TCentral Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP) in the last general election, has called on the Federal Government to make Nnewi a full economic hub by providing necessary amenities to make businesses thrive in the area. Muognalu, who made the call last week during the Nnewi 2020 Investment Summit at the Conv-Aj Center, Nnewi, contended that Nnewi would hardly become a successful manufacturing hub based on the efforts of the private sector alone. “In the efforts to make Nnewi a full economic hub, the Federal Government must be heavily involved. They must have a strategy. They must know the kind of industries they would want to support.

The economic thinking of those in government has to change. Import substitution as applied in Nigeria, is no longer a viable approach in an age of globalisation; government need to make our manufacturing industries to be competitive, and that’s why they must invest in innovations and in improving the skills of the workforce,” he said.
