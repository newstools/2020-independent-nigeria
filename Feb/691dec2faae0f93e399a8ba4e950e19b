WARRI  – Elder statesman, Edward Nikagbatse-Oki, has enjoined Nigerians to join hands with the present government to tackle corruption, nepotism and insecurity presently plaguing the country. According to him, Nigeria will be greater if we embrace peace and Nigerianism in all facets and shun those things that tend to divide us. Edward Oki made the call during the official presentation of Friendship is Peace International (FIPI) and Nigerianism calendars for the year 2020 and 2021 before newsmen in Warri Delta State, adding that what Nigeria needed was not political system, but the will to fight evil tendencies, capable of setting the country backward.

A lot of people want peace and justice and not restructuring: both journalists and well meaning Nigerians have a role to play in propagating Nigerianism and peace through friendship among Nigerians,” he said, insisting that the country must be greater again among the comity of nations.
