Awka- The Chairman House of Assembly Committee on Environment and lawmaker representing Onitsha-North 2 state constituency in the Anambra State House of Assembly, Hon. Edward Obiefuna Ibuzo has identified ethnicity and tribalistic sentiments as bane of Nigeriaâ€™s development. Ibuzo frowned at the idea of considering the tribe or ethnic group one belonged to in securing job appointments and the like rather than being cognizant of the fact that, if the individual is a Nigerian citizen. The lawmaker who recounted his experience in Kigali the Rwandan capital while speaking during an exclusive interview with our correspondent in Awka at the weekend , noted that in other countries, no one talks about tribe or nepotistic tendencies but considers the country at large.

According to him, many years after independence from colonial rule, Nigeria still grapples with stagnation and under-development due to ethnocentric approach to issues of nation building and national development. Ibuzo therefore suggested that it was time the Nigerian government began to look beyond tribal as well as regional considerations and apply the concept of federal character as the constitution provides and eschew other parochial interests that could be detrimental to the running of national affairs. Also the House of Assembly Committee Chairman on Environment, disclosed further that the committee in its oversight functions, will ensure that the environment is not abused through blockage of drainage, indiscriminate building of structures on waterways as well as general inhumane attitudes to the ecosystem.
