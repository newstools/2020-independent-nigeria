Daboh, who noted that proliferation of illegal gas stations in the state had reached a worrisome level, said the agency would continue to clamp down on all the illegal gas plants in the state. “Most of these gas plants are not only illegal but, do not meet safety guidelines on the establishment of gas plants. “And as an agency mandated with responsibility of ensuring safety in oil and gas industry, we cannot fold our arms watching people operating illegally. “As matter of fact, we are giving all illegal gas skid operators in the state till end of February to close shop, while those with expired licences should come for renewal. “We are not saying they should not do their businesses, but they must be ready to follow the required safety. “This attitude of operating illegally cannot be tolerated and that is why our surveillance team will not leave any stone unturned in its bid to ensure that safety standards were maintained in the gas business in the state”, Daboh said. The Head Operations also said that the agency would not rest until all the illegal gas plants in the state were shut,  adding that the safety of the gas users was paramount to the department.
