The Kaduna Chamber of Commerce, Industry Mines and Agriculture (KADCIMMA) said that over 700 exhibitors would attend the 41st Kaduna International Trade Fair slated, which starts February 28, 2020. Dr. Muheeba Dankaka, the President of Chamber, disclosed this in an interview with journalists in the state. Dankaka said the exhibitors were being expected from within and outside the country at the Fair and expressed optimism that exhibitors at this year’s event would surpass those that attended in 2019.

Dankaka said the choice of the theme of the Fair was informed by the need to discuss opportunities inherent in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA) pact, which is aimed at integrating the economies of the African continent. She said the security situation as reported in the media is blown out of proportion as Kaduna is safe for both visitors and exhibitors. “I assure you that the number of participants this year will be higher than what we recorded last year,” she said.
