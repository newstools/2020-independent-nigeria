ASABA – Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has assured authorities of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) of the state government’s continued support to the scheme. Okowa gave the assurance on Thursday while inaugurating a 720-capacity hostel for NYSC members at the Permanent Orientation Camp in Issele-Uku, Aniocha South Local Government Area of the state. He recalled that the camp was in a poor state when he visited in 2018, and expressed delight that the camp had begun to wear a look befitting a place where corps members spent time before being deployed to parts of the state for primary assignment. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “This is a dream come true and we thank God that we are witnessing this great transformation of the orientation camp. As a government, I believe that we should improve on the facilities that we have in this orientation camp as we are collaborating with the Federal Government in different ways”. “Just few days ago, on Monday, a Court of Appeal was inaugurated in Asaba. I am happy that we have the Court of Appeal and it has been described as apparently, one of the best in the country. “The graduates numbering thousands who are posted to Delta, apparently, will work in Delta State and will impact on the state and its people. So, it is only human that we make them comfortable to bring out their best to serve the state and our nation. “It gladdens my heart that we are here to inaugurate a 700-capacity bed-space hostel for Corps members; four blocks of twin three-bedroom flats and several other projects. In the next couple of weeks, construction work will commence on the internal roads, a multi-purpose hall and we shall also construct a hostel to be named after Chief (Sir) B.S.C. Elue, former Deputy Governor, Delta State,” Okowa said.
