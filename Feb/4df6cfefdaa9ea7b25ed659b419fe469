Donald Trump has often ridiculed the impeachment effort against him and he didn’t fail to do  it again over the weekend. The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, don’t want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax, they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election, & that includes the House & Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far!— Donald J.
