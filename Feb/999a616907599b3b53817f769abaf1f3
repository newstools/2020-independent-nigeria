Governor Abdulrahaman Abdulrazak will any moment from now, launch what will be novel centrally controlled state security command called Operation Harmony. While details of the outfit are a bit sketchy early Thursday morning, Daily Independent exclusively gathered that the operation is a response to the growing security concerns in the state and the dilemma as to where Kwara belongs in the face of the Amotekun being floated by South West governors and traditional rulers. As also learnt, the governor has purchased 19 operational vehicles for the security project. Confirming this development, Rafiu Ajakaiye, chief press secretary, CPS, to Governor Abdulrazak said, “I can confirm that the administration has purchased 19 vehicles which are meant for the soon-to-be-reorganized Operation Harmony.

That, of course, is only a fraction of the many initiatives of the government to boost security”. More details later.
