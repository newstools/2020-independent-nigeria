Owing to the bumper harvest which commenced late last year, prices of plantain which started declining in August last year became evident in December 2019, but reducing further since then. The situation saw lovers of the commodity especially diabetic patients appreciating the value of their purchasing power in their procurements. Likewise, some of the traders were able to up their supplies while those who could not, maintained their normal purchases. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Plantain is a staple food in Nigeria and majorly supplied from Edo, Ondo and Ijebu Waterside. Prices of the commodity are influenced by seasonal factors and irrespective of the season, plantain still enjoys appreciable level of patronage from consumers, particularly diabetic patients. During the week, findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of SUNDAY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of the commodity still remained  stable, showing no significant difference from what was sold  between December 2019 and  February 6, 2020. Reasons predominantly mentioned for the stability in prices were improved supply and availability owing to bumper harvest. Visit to Wuse Market, Abuja, indicated that prices of plantain remained stable, with prices of a big bunch still going for between N1,500 and N1,800  while that of the small bunch  attracted between N800 and N1,000 but this, however, depends on the size and the haggling power of the buyer. Madam Paulina, who trades in the commodity at the Wuse Market, Abuja, ascribed the situation to availability usually common in the season of plenty. At the Ogbeogologo Market, Asaba, prices of six big bunches of plantain sold previously for between N7,500 and N9,000 changed slightly, currently ranging from N7,800 to N8,500. Likewise the small bunch, remained unchanged at between N3000 and N3,500 of which many of the traders linked to increased supply. For Ose Market, Onitsha, prices of plantain remained at a declining trend with six big bunches still selling for  between N7,500 and N8,500 while that of the small bunch attracted between N3000 and N3,300. Mr. Onoshe Chuddy, who trades in the commodity at the Ose Market, Onitsha, said on-season effect was responsible for the continued decline. In Oba Market, Benin City, the home of plantain, prices of the commodity appeared to be more favourable, with six small bunches currently selling within the range of N2,500 and N3,300 as against between N3,000 and N3,500. But that of the big bunches still remained unchanged at between N6,500 and N8,000 depending on the size and bargaining power of buyer. Mrs. Rebecca Onuigbo who trades in the commodity at the Oba Market, Benin City, said the reduction in prices was expected, being its season of abundance. The same could be said for that of Itam Market Uyo, especially with prices of six big bunches of plantain still going for between N9,000 and N10,500 from N12,000 sold during the period of scarcity. The small bunches also remained unchanged at between N3,500 and N4,000. Many of the traders at the Itam Market, Uyo, connected the situation to availability usually associated with the season of plenty.

Mr. Ayorinde Wasiu, a plantain seller at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, said that seasonal factors were responsible for the persistent decline. This is just as Mariam Abbey, another trader of the same market, shared similar view but connected the situation to low patronage. In Bodija Market, Ibadan, the display of the commodity and the manner at which traders were beckoning on customers for patronage indicated they were willing to sell the commodity at give-away prices to avoid loss and this usually occurs in its season of plenty. For example, prices of six big bunches of  plantain initially sold for between N9,500 and N10,500 declined further, currently ranging from N8,500 to N10,000 depending on the size and the negotiating power of the customer. Likewise that of the small bunch still selling for between N2,800 and N3,500. Many of the traders at the Bodija Market, Ibadan, linked the situation to improved supply resulting to availability. In Lagos, visit to popular markets such as Idi-Oro and Oke-Afa, Isolo, showed that prices of plantain remained at a downward trend especially with prices of six big bunches still going for between N9,000 and N10,500 while that of the small ones  had not changed from between N3,500 and N4,200. Mrs. Risikat Oni who trades in the commodity at the Oke-Afa Market, Isolo attributed the decline availability and increased supply arising from on-season effect.
