It was announced back in October that Dave Lewis would be leaving, and at that time Lewis was scheduled to depart in summer 2020. However, Lewis will now remain until September 30 “to facilitate a smooth and seamless handover” with Murphy succeeding him and joining the board October 1 “after fully respecting his contractual non-compete obligations”.
