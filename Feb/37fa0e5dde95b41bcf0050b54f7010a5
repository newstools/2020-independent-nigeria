An Emirati man threatened to share intimate pictures of his former fiancée unless she rekindled their relationship, a court heard. The 34-year-old remained friends with the woman after their split – but he allegedly launched a blackmail plot when she got engaged again and broke off contact. The accused is said to have forced the woman to hand over Dh20,000 in return for not publishing the images.

She reported the incident to Al Qusais Police Station and the defendant was summoned for questioning. He denied charges of blackmail and issuing threats and insults at a court hearing on Sunday. The case was adjourned until February 18.
