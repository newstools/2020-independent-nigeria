Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba ‘would not mind’ going back to Juventus this summer, his agent Mino Raiola has confirmed. The 26-year-old is hoping to leave Old Trafford for the second time this summer and MEN Sport revealed he has already made his teammates aware of his intentions to move on. Real Madrid have been favourites for a long time to lure the midfielder out of United and Pogba added fuel to the fire in the summer by claiming he was ‘ready for a new challenge.’ Powered by RubiQube Ad Network And Raiola has given another update on his client’s future admitting a move back to Juventus, where United bought him from in the summer of 2016, could be on the cards. “Italy is like home for Paul. He would not mind going back to Juve but we will see what will happen after the Euros,” Raiola told reporters after Juventus vs AC Milan on Thursday. “Paul wants to play at the best level but he can’t escape by Manchester United if they are in a difficult situation.” Pogba has only started six times this season due to injury and while his teammates have been on a training camp in Spain he has been working hard to get back to full fitness in Dubai. And despite regularly being drawn into transfer chat Raiola said just last month the midfielder’s priority is getting fit before any potential transfers are considered.••• “I expect my players to be happy and I expect the clubs to be happy,” Raiola said in January. “I don’t want to work in front of what will be happening in the summer. He needs to get fit then it is my job to get both parties happy if possible. If both parties are not happy there are other ways to resolve it but that is not the way to talk today. “I don’t say anything for sure. Only one thing is for sure in life. One day, you die. Today he is not happy because he is not playing. But he went back to Man United when a lot of people didn’t think he would. People forget that.”
