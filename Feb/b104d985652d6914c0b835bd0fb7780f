Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has revealed that his administration has raised 50,000 hybrid Cocoa seedlings meant for distribution to farmers at affordable prices moment they mature in 18 months. “This is being done to ensure the prompt and effective rehabilitation and regeneration of the aged Cocoa plantations or farms existing in the State,” Governor AbdulRazaq disclosed at the recent Cocoa Farmers’ Roundtable Conference held at Cocoa House, Oke Onigbin, Isin Local Government Area of the State. AbdulRazaq, represented by the State Commissioner for Agricultural and Rural Development, Mrs Adenike Afolabi-Oshatimehin, said the government would establish a Cocoa nursery in the State to serve as the genuine source of planting materials for the farmers.

This is being done to enhance the quality of the cocoa beans being produced in the State. Besides, we also intend to look into prospects of being able to possibly address extant challenges associated with some of the critical input requirements of cocoa farmers in the state,” he added. Governor AbdulRazaq explained that the present administration understands that lack of basic social amenities, physical infrastructure, et al, could constitute disincentives for farming in agrarian communities in the State, saying “it is for this reason and more that we are committing significant resources to road construction, healthcare, water and basic education in the 2020 budget, which has just been passed and assented to.”
