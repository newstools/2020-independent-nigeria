LAGOS – As part of its corporate social responsibility, the Rotary Club of Lagos Island (RCLI) District 9110, in partnership with Ishk Tolaram Foundation, graduated 35 Lagos residents in electrical management as well as community works. Dr. Jide Akeredolu, District Governor, Rotary International District 9110, speaking at the weekend during an event to mark the graduation ceremony and presentation of certificates to some volunteers, who had received a two-day training in electrical management, electrical engineering and community works, said the occasion enabled RCLI and Ishk Tolaram Foundation to impart a lot of expertise and knowledge on volunteers free of charge. “Today, we are here to give them certificates. It is one of the areas of focus of the Rotary Club. The RCLI has partnered with the Ishk Tolaram Foundation to do a lot of community works in the area where they are based.” Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Akeredolu, who said that many of the trained electrical engineers would go back to their communities to impart others, noted that the training has made an impact in their lives as well as enabled them to become be more economically solvent. “Some of them who are employed before the training will become employers of labour and in that way, they will be more self-reliant and if that succeeds, then the RCLI has become successful in that area,” Akeredolu added. President-elect, RCLI, Sanjay Srivastava, at the event, noted that between September 2019 and January, the RCLI trained and graduated about 200 persons in electrical engineering, power-generating set production, erecting and managing solar and grid as means of power, among others. He advised Nigerian youths to make themselves available for more trainings in energy sector, which provide them with a lot of employment opportunities.
