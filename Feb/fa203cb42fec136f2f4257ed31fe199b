 Ughelli – Senatorial Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta Central District in the last election, Rt. Hon. Evelyn Omovowan Oboro has sympathized with the families of those who lost their live ones to Saturday herdsmen attack on Agadama, Ohorhor and other Uwherun communities in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State. Oboro in a statement condemned the brazen murder and killing of innocent citizens of the communities in attacks by alleged herdsmen. Oboro, immediate past member of House of Representatives who represented Okpe, Sapele, Uvwie Federal Constituency said the killings were “pure acts of barbarism and terrorism against the people. The killings are callous, provocative, wicked and premeditated”. “It smacks of a clear intent to decimate a particular ethnic group even in their own fatherland. No one knows their next target because as it stands now, various communities in Uwherun have become endangered species,” she said. Oboro urged security agencies to rise up to the occasion through intelligence gathering rather than engaging in reactionary and after effect fire brigade approach.
