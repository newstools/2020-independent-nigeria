LAGOS – Aero Contractors has invested the sum of N200m in software to boost efficiency in its Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facilities. This is, as the airline said that it had carried out C-checks on at least 20 aircraft in the past 30 months since it commercialised its MRO hangar at the Murtala Muhammed Airport 9MMA), Lagos. Capt. Ado Sanusi, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Aero Contractors disclosed this in Lagos yesterday during the unveiling of Ramco Aviation Software Company based in Chennai, India. According to Sanusi, its partnership with Ramco would run for five years, stressing that this would eliminate paper documentation in its MRO hangar, which the company started with in 2017 to digital documentation. He explained that this would increase performance of its technical personnel at its MRO centre, capture man-hour throughput and enhances safety in the system. With the digitalisation of its MRO hangar, Aero Contractors has become the first company on the continent to do so. The Aero’s helmsman noted that since the commmercialisation of the facility in 2017, it has carried out 30 C-checks on Boeing B737 aircraft within the country and beyond. Sanusi said: “We at Aero, we are very proud of our achievements in our MRO. We have gone all the way to 6 C-check from the two checks we began with, and we hope to expand in our operations. With our agreement, everything with the MRO will be automated. We are very proud of that because this will enhance safety in the system.”
