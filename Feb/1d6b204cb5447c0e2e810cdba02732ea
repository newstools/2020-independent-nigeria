The 2014/2015 season was very particular in the history of the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL). It was one season that the nationâ€™s topflight recorded 31 away wins, which was then and still now unprecedented. But this season, the away performances of certain teams have sparked interesting conversation about the possibility of breaking the record of total away wins in a season. Debutants, Dakkada FC, have hit the elite division by storm, losing just one away game (against MFM FC) in the first half of the season. Interestingly, a record number of 15 teams have already recorded at least one away win after an incomplete first round of matches this season (incomplete giving that team like Enyimba and Rangers still have outstanding games). With 23 away wins already, perhaps, there is a huge prospect of eclipsing the 31-away wins record set in 2015 season. Just like away wins recorded by at least 15 teams, some teams have shown very canny brilliance in their home forms, which has been behind their position on the log. For instance, despite the away brilliance of most teams this season, some have only benefited from their home performance than others. A solid home record is usually the foundation of any successful campaign for a team, and it is not surprising the following teams have thrived on such background. FC Ifeanyiubah, for example, are currently placed 12th on the NPFL standings and the Anambra Warriors occupy the position largely based on their imperious home form, which is a sharp contrast from away results. Perhaps, head Coach Uche Okagbue needs to tweak their away form in order to fully explore the benefits of their home form. Other teams that have worked wonders in their homes include Plateau United, Sunshine Stars and Lobi Stars, among others.
