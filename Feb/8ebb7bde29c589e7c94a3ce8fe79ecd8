Since after they were bundled out of the CAF Confederation Cup, Rangers International of Enugu have shown promising performances and they took that form to Uyo last Sunday as they forced Akwa United to a goalless draw in one of the week nineteen games. However, at the Cathedral this Sunday, the reverse fixture will pitch the two sides, as the Flying Antelopes will look to continue their resurgence towards leaving the dreaded red zone. With 20 points from 15 games, the Flying Antelopes will have no need losing particularly their home matches. Recall that in the season so far, they lost at home to Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, as well as Dakkada FC, who beat them 1-0 and 2-0 respectively in results that compounded their then very poor showing at the continent. But after elimination from the continent, Rangers drew with Lobi Stars in Makurdi, with the Flying Antelopes drawing the first blood in the 43rd minute through Israel Abia and the Ortom Boys leveling four minutes into the first half extra time. In Uyo last Sunday, the played very well and at a time dominated the game and the match ended goalless. But Abia who scored the lone goal against Lobi Stars has vowed that they would get past Akwa United in Enugu, noting that their precarious position on the log warranted that they up their game against the Promise Keepers. “It is a game we are going to give everything in order to win because we must continue to go up the table. “We are not going to win the game easy so we are not going to underrate them, but if we must avoid relegation at the end of the season, we must begin to take advantage of games like this,” he said.
