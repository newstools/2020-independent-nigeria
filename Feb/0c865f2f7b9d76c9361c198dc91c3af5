LAGOS – Chief Emeka C. Kalu, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain has expressed support for the recent deregistration of 74 political parties by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Kalu, who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT in Lagos on Thursday, maintained that the listing of 74 political parties out the 93 that hitherto existed was proper. He maintained that most of the delisted political parties were formed to obtain money from people and the government, “so it is great they deregistered them.” Kalu, Director General (DG), Protocols, Peoples Democratic Party Youth Alliance (PDPYA), stressed that anyone who wanted to run for office should use a confirmed party, and not mushroom groups masquerading as political parties.
