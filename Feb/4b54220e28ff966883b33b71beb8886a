ABUJA – The Gender Department of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Social Development Secretariat, has revealed that no fewer than seven persons would be standing trial before the FCT Family Court for various child abuse offences. Dr. Agnes Uta Hart, the Director of the department, expressed worries over the increasing rate of child abuse in the territory, regretting that the department entertains an average of four assault cases in a week. She made this known while interrogating some guardians alleged to have assaulted minors in their care, stressing that the administration has zero tolerance for any form of abuse of any resident. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Hart warned that the full weight of the law would be applied to anyone found guilty of abusing other people, especially children. She said, “Here in the FCT, we have a sexual and gender base response team, and we have zero tolerance to any form of abuse against any resident, let alone violence on a child. Nobody in the FCT can molest a child and go scot-free. “The Child Right Act 2003 is very clear on that; every child has the right to life, right to quality education, right to healthcare and other fundamental human rights as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and we are here to protect the interest of the child to the letter. “This week alone we have received four cases of child abuse and violence against children and this has been the trend.  At present, we have seven of such cases in the FCT Family Court and we are going to follow through with all of such cases.” Earlier some guardians, Mr. and Mrs. Moses Onoja, and Mrs. Ada Okamba, were paraded for allegedly assaulting and inflicting serious injuries on 10-year-old Precious and 14-year-old Chineye Nwoka, respectively. The victims were both noticed by their teachers who reported the assault to the FCT Gender Department.
