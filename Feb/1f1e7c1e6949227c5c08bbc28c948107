According to Omote, the recent happenings in Ughelli North and Ughelli South LGAs has became major concern for the people because businesses are no longer thriving as it use to be. “The rate of insecurity is alarming in these areas, in Ughelli South, last month, Paul Onomuakpokpo was killed by unknown persons and within interval of days or weeks, Mrs. Agnes Atiku was kidnapped and presently, we held that another person just escaped assassination attempt and he is receiving treatment from gunshot wounds. “In Ughelli North, the story is the same, at the Oteri-Ughelli axis it has been the case of either kidnap or attempt murder. “I am appealing to the state Commissioner of Police, local government chairmen of these areas and other security agents to rejig the security approach towards the combating of crime because we can no longer sleep with our eyes closed.”
