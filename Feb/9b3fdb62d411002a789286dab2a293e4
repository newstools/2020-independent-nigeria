Adamu, who was represented by the Deputy Director, Water Quality Control and Sanitation, Federal Ministry of Water Resources, Mr Ibiyemi Olu-Daniel, said the group would be responsible for the monitoring, assessment and interaction of response to cholera outbreak in the state. He called on the committee members to work as a team to safeguard the lives of the residents.
