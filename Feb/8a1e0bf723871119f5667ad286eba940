The Juventus striker appeared to be lost for words after being surprised with a brand new Mercedes Benz BRABUS following a dinner date at Turin’s Ristorante Casa Fiore. Confetti reigned down on an unsuspecting Ronaldo as he made his way onto the street, where the 888 horsepower vehicle – which can sell for as much as £600,000 (N242 million) – had been adorned with a large red bow. Capturing the moment in a short Instagram video, Georgina, 26, looked on as Portuguese footballer greeted waiting friends and fans, among them nine-year old son Cristiano, Jr – the oldest of his four children. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Captioning the video in her native Spanish, she wrote: ‘Congratulations to the man of my life! What a desire to transport our love in your gift.’ Widely considered to be one of the best off-road vehicles on the market, the lavish gift can reach speeds of up to 62-miles an hour in just 3.8 seconds. Ronaldo is believed to own as many as 20 cars, among the one-off Bugatti La Voiture Noire – reportedly the most expensive car ever built. Reports suggest Ronaldo spent €11million (£9.49million) on the unique Bugatti which was first presented to the world at the Geneva Motor Show 2019. The French luxury company built only one of the prototype supercar and it is a tribute to the 110th anniversary of the founding of the company. The car is a modern interpretation of the mythical and legendary Bugatti Type 57 SC Atlantic, four of which were built between 1936 and 1938. His collection also reportedly includes a Mercedes C Class Sport Coupe, a Rolls-Royce Phantom, a Ujn Ferrari 599 GTO, a Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, an Aston Martin DB9, a McLaren MP4 12C and a Bentley Continental GTC Speed. Speaking to Piers Morgan in 2019, the footballer admitted he owned ‘two of everything’ – including two Bugatti’s, two Ferrari’s, two McLaren’s and two Rolls Royce’s. Mail Online
