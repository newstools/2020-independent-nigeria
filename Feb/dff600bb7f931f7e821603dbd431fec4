Several parishioners of Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church, Lagere, Ile-Ife, on Thursday wept uncontrollably during the requiem Mass and the burial of their six members. The deceased died on Sunday morning in a fatal accident at Eripa near Iree while returning from the annual pilgrimage to Oke Maria, Otan Ayegbaju in Boluwaduro Local government Area of Osun. They were buried at the Church’s Cemetery, located at Mayfair, Ile-Ife, after the requiem Mass.

Bishop Emmanuel Badejo of the Catholic Diocese of Oyo delivered the homily during the Mass titled: `Blessed are those that mourn, for they shall be comforted.’ Badejo told the parishioners and others at the Mass that only God knew the reason why he allowed such a disaster to have happened. He said that no one could question God, adding, that this was not the first time that Catholic members had traveled to Oke-Maria for the annual pilgrimage. He thanked God for the lives well spent by the deceased, and for dying in the cause of professing their faith through the pilgrimage. Badejo said that though people were grieved and were mourning the loss of their loved ones on earth, he reminded them that Heaven was rejoicing and welcoming them. The bishop urged all and sundry to move closer to God at this end-time because death is inevitable and that all will taste it one day. Also, Archbishop Gabriel Abegunrin of Ibadan Archdiocese advised Christians, especially, Catholic members not to lose hope and their faith at the cost of any evil event. Abegunrin charged them to continue serving the Lord and put Satan to shame by not allowing the recent disaster to draw them far from their maker. “Rather, move closer to God,’’ he said.
