ILORIN – Parties in the dispute about revocation of land on which Ile-Arugbo structure was built at the GRA of Ilorin are yet to have headway in their out-of-court settlement of the matter. The parties, Kwara State Government and the Asa Investments Limited owned by the late political icon of the state, Olusola Saraki, had been granted their request to settle the case out of court. They held the first out-of-court settlement meeting last Thursday after the state High Court in Ilorin hearing the matter had granted the request. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The meeting attended by legal representatives of the government led by the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in the state, Salman Jawondo, and those of the Asa Investments led by Abdulazeez Ibrahim, was postponed to Tuesday as the parties, after its conclusion, told newsmen they were on negotiation stage. When newsmen interviewed Ibrahim, after the Tuesday meeting he disclosed that the meeting was yet to agree on terms of settlement. He said the parties had postponed the meeting indefinitely with the hope that when they would meet again they would be able to agree on terms of settlement from each side. The government parties, when approached by newsmen for interview, said the meeting was yet to have a resolution. The government had revoked the land on the ground that it was allegedly unlawfully and illegally allocated to the company and, with the allocation, denied the original purpose it was meant for which to build the third phase of secretariat for the state civil servants.
