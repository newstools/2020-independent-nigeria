A woman who blinded her boyfriend in one eye after attacking him with a table and extension lead has been jailed. Claire Wilson, 39, was sentenced to nine years when she appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Friday. Wilson, from Leicester, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent on 22 November 2019,  following a trial at the same court. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The incident happened on August 11, 2018, when Wilson and her partner checked into a Premier Inn hotel in Loughborough, Leicestershire. During the course of the evening, they drank alcohol before returning to the room – whereby an argument ensued. Wilson used both a table and extension cord in the room as weapons, causing serious injuries to the man, who was able to report the incident at reception. Police were called and she was arrested inside the hotel. The victim’s injuries were so bad he lost an eye and now wears a prosthetic implant. Detective Constable Nicola Davies, from Leicestershire Police’s Domestic Abuse Investigation Unit (DAIU), was the investigating officer. She said: “This case is an example that men can also be victims of domestic violence. “The injuries the man suffered have had a profound impact on his quality of life and could prohibit him from gaining employment in future. “I’ve also little doubt what happened will have affected his own confidence and could impact on future relationships. “This was a very complex investigation that required support from other agencies. “I hope the outcome of this case can serve as a warning that the force takes a zero-tolerance approach to domestic abuse.”
