ABUJA – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday, warned the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, not to meddle in the internal affairs of the party. The party in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan asked the Speaker to concentrate on his legislative duties instead of interfering in the party’s affairs. The PDP explained that its warning to Gbajabiamila is predicated on his reported needless interferences in the choice of leadership of the PDP Caucus in the House of Representatives, leading to intimidation and threats of sanctions against PDP Caucus leaders led by Hon. Kingsley Chinda.

Kingsley Chinda, Hon. Yakubu Barde, Hon. Chukwuma Onyema and Hon. Muraina Ajibola. This position has not changed. “The PDP recognizes the caucus roles of our members and they have the instructions of our party to do so.” It should be recalled that minority position had been an issue in PDP. While the party’s choice is Chinda, Ndudi Elumelu was elected by majority of PDP members in House as their Minority Leader.
