The Blue Hats later announced the square was under their control after protesters were moved out. Meanwhile, in Babil, one person was killed after the Blue Hats attacked protesters in the central Iraqi city. Protesters were staging sit-ins in the backdrop of appointing of Mohammed Allawi as a prime minister. Iraqi President Barham Salih assigned Allawi on Saturday to form a government within a month. Iraq has been roiled by mass protests since early October over poor living conditions and corruption, forcing Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi to resign. More than 600 people have been killed and 17,000 injured in protests, according to an Iraqi human rights commission.
