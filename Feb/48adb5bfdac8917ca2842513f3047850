Key oil producing countries led by Saudi Arabia and Russia yesterday appear set to implement 600,000 b/d of new production cuts for three months starting in March to counter the demand destruction caused by the coronavirus outbreak, according to a delegate involved in the talks That would apparently be on top of their existing 1.7 million b/d output cut accord that began in January and expires at the end of March. Meanwhile, any deal would require unanimous approval of all 23 ministers in the OPEC+ coalition, composed of OPEC, Russia and nine other allies. Their next scheduled meeting is March 5-6 in Vienna but delegates have said it could be moved forward. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The coronavirus has sparked fears of a major economic slowdown in China, the world’s largest importer of crude, where quarantines and travel restrictions have caused a contraction in oil consumption. China sources some 70% of its crude imports from OPEC+ members and its refineries are expected to slash runs by about 1 million b/d in February, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. Delegates were called to a hastily arranged technical committee meeting this week, which included extensive reviews of several scenarios attempting to quantify the uncertain oil market impact of the still-spreading virus. It would be recalled that OPEC and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, weighed the impact on global oil demand and economic growth from the coronavirus outbreak at a meeting on Tuesday, hearing from China’s envoy to the United Nations in Vienna. Producers are considering further output cuts and moving a planned policy meeting to February rather than March.
