Senators just voted to find President Trump not guilty on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. The vote was 52-48. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney was the only Republican to vote to convict Trump. He’s the first senator in US history to vote to convict a president from the same party in an impeachment trial. The Senate will now vote on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress.
