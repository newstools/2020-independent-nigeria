Apple’s smartwatch dominance, which saw it ship more Apple Watch units than the entire Swiss watch industry, means competitors will have to find new creative ways to steal away some of that market share. Samsung could be best placed to do just that. A recent patent for a potential upcoming Samsung device caught my eye. No, it’s not for a new smartwatch – rather a new smart speaker with a flexible display. In essence, the device has a typical cylindrical shape you’d expect from a smart speaker, but it has a display that wraps around the outside of the device. It then unfolds, when needed, into a flat square screen. The Korean company is clearly planning to use its new foldable manufacturing skills on more than just smartphones, which could potentially include a smartwatch. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Samsung’s current Gear and Galaxy smartwatch range – whilst capable – has not, and may never, replicate the popularity of the Apple Watch. But a foldable screen wearable might. One of the core issues with current smartwatches is that the small display is limiting. Messages – or any text – is awkward to read – but a watch with a display that can extend potentially solves that issue. Today In: Innovation As smartwatches become more capable and take on more functionality, they will always be limited by the small display. Having a watch that can operate independently of your phone with access to your most-used apps is hampered by the fact that you have to squint – or pull out your phone – to read to a simple message. A foldable Gear, however, could be truly independent of a smartphone with a display that’s big enough to read a text, usefully functional apps and house a passable virtual keyboard. Such a device would straddle the intersection between wearable and smartphone (we know how tech companies like to find new categories) and potentially replace both.
