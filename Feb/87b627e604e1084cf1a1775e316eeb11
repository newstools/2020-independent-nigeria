Amazon has become the latest to withdraw from Mobile World Congress 2020 over coronavirus concerns, following in the footsteps of LG, Ericsson and Nvidia. The steady stream of drop-outs and the increasing severity of safety measures introduced by the organiser have cast doubts over the viability of the renowned mobile show. Since coronavirus was first identified in China’s Hubei province, over 40,000 infections have been confirmed and nearly 1,000 have lost their lives. “Due to the outbreak and continued concerns about novel coronavirus, Amazon will withdraw from exhibiting and participating in Mobile World Congress 2020,” said an Amazon spokesperson.
