JANET NYAJON AUDU JALINGO – Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku of Taraba State on Tuesday received a delegation of the national women wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) at Taraba House, Asokoro, Abuja. Ishaku used the visit of the women leaders to call on Christians all over the county to stand firm in solidarity with people of the same fate who were being killed all over the country. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network He decried the current spate of killings by Boko Haram, kidnapping and other forms of insurgency, noting that these crimes were capable of hindering socio-economic development of the country. He emphasised the place of peace as a critical ingredient of development, explaining that it was for this reason that the Open Grazing Restriction Law was passed by the Taraba State government under his watch. He said the law was meant to ensure peaceful relationship between farmers and herders. He told the visiting women Christian leaders about the country’s need for prayers, urging them not to relent in praying for peace in the country. Ishaku said the problem with Christian groups in the country was that they were not united in a manner that they could speak and act decisively on issues, urging them to close ranks because the happenings around the country called for unity among them. Leader of the delegation, Deaconess Victoria Bola Ihesiulor, thanked the governor for the developmental strides recorded by his administration in Taraba State, assuring that her group would continue to pray for him and his wife, Barrister Anna Ishaku, for the good works they had been doing for the people of Taraba State.
