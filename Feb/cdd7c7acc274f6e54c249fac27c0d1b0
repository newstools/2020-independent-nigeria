Louis Oosthuizen, South African golfers and Brandon Stone have given a rough outline on their aims for the 2020 season ahead.
Oosthuizen revealed to the European Tour his goals for the year and stated that he would like to get back into the Top 10 at the end of 2020.
The 37-year-old is currently the country’s top-ranked golfer at 15th in World Golf Rankings.
Despite going winless in 2019, Oosthuizen managed eight Top 10 finishes and only missed two cuts in 23 tournaments.
The 2010 Open Championship also stated that he would like to contend in the four Majors.
In 2019, Oosthuizen’s best Major finish occurred at the 119th US Open at Pebble Beach, where he finished T7.
Meanwhile, Stone revealed that his goals for the year include a Top 20 finish on the European Tour’s Race to Dubai rankings.
The 213rd ranked golfer is a three-time European Tour winner with his last win coming at the Scottish Open at Gullane in 2018.
2019 has been poor season for Stone, as he only managed to secure one Top 10 finish in 24 tournaments – missing 13 cuts.
Stone’s third and final goal of the year is to “not break a golf club” and let’s just say it’s not as easy as it looks!
Oosthuizen is not competing in any tournament this week, while Stone is in George playing in the Dimension Data Pro-Am.
