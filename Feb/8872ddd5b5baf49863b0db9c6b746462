Unicef while calling for a permanent stop of the practice of female genital cutting which it said was predominantly rampant in Africa regretted that such a practice violates the rights of women and girls. The organization seized the opportunity to urge stakeholders to intensify steps towards eliminating the obnoxious harmful practice of women and girls genital mutilation by adopting coordinated and systematic efforts, promoting policies and positive action, engaging communities with a focus on human rights, gender equality, sexual education and attention to the needs of women and girls who suffer from the consequences of female genital circumcision.
