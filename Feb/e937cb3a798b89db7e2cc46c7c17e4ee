LAGOS – Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, said on Saturday that the final pull out of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) is an astonishing moment of hope for the UK people. The UK, which was a member of the EU for 47 years finally pulled out of the European Union late Friday after over three years of a referendum on Brexit. Reacting to the development via a message he posted on the social media, Johnson noted that the direction of evolution of the EU does not suit the United Kingdom any longer.

And then of course there is a third group – perhaps the biggest – who had started to worry that the whole political wrangle would never come to an end. “I understand all those feelings and our job as the government – my job – is to bring this country together now and take us forward. “For all its strengths and for all its admirable qualities, the EU has evolved over 50 years in a direction that no longer suits this country,” the message read in part. He further said that the moment is not end but a beginning and a moment of real national renewal. “The most important thing to say tonight is that this is not an end but a beginning and a moment of real national renewal and change. “When I look at the potential of this country waiting to be unleashed, I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success. And whatever the bumps in the road ahead, I know that we will succeed.”
