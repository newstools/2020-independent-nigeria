ABUJA – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday reacted to the travel ban placed on Nigeria by the United States of America (USA). PDP said that Nigerians should hold the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) responsible for the negative impacts of the proposed travel sanctions imposed on the country by the United States. PDP, in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, described the sanction as yet another huge misfortune brought by the Buhari Presidency and the APC, which had continued to wreck the nation with its compromised handling of security issues, in addition to escalated bloodletting and human rights violation under their watch.
