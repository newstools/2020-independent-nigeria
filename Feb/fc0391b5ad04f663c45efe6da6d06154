LAGOS â€“  Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, Chief Emeka C. Kalu, has urged the South East governors to emulate their South West counterparts by coming together to set up a regional security outfit to protect their people from the menace of Fulani herdsmen and other criminals. Kalu, Director General (DG), Protocols, Peoples Democratic Party Youth Alliance (PDPYA), who spoke to Saturday INDEPENDENT in Lagos on Friday, said the activities of herdsmen, kidnappings, armed robbers and bandits in the region had become very worrisome and alarming. He noted that even as the legal framework for Operation Amotekun was yet to be established, the knowledge of their coming on board despite obvious plans by the Federal Government to stop them, had already put fear on the criminal elements operating in the South West and crimes had already reduced in the region.
