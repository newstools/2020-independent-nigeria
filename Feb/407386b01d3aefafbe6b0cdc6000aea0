South Africa’s rand kept tumbling on Friday, sliding to a new 12-week low after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global emergency, compounding local economic issues faced by the currency. State firm Eskom, a major threat to growth and government’s balance sheet as it struggles to service its 450 billion rand debt, said on Friday nationwide blackouts would continue as it carried out long-delayed maintenance on its creaking fleet coal plants. At 1500 GMT the rand was 1.31% weaker at 14.9580 per dollar, its worst level since Nov. 11, bringing losses for the week to nearly 4% – the worst amongst emerging market peers, which also suffered as investors dumped risk assets for safer bets. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network BNP Paribas economist Jeffrey Schultz said that although concern about the coronavirus outbreak was the major factor driving the market, news that power cuts were continuing added further pressure. “This has made markets quite nervous considering the already-weak growth outlook going into the February budget,” said Schultz.
