The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) yesterday commended the Federal Government’s policy on foreign exchange ban on importation of milk and dairy foods, adding that the decision is an indication of government’s responsiveness to good reasoning and the concern of businesses organisations in the country. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had last week placed a foreign exchange ban on importation of milk and dairy foods with the exemption of six companies from restriction on milk and dairy products importation. NECA, however, charged the government to be consistent with its policies, while also encouraging investment in animal husbandry to enable these organisations and many other players in the industry to focus on their core business of dairy and milk production. Timothy Olawale, the Director- General of NECA, speaking with journalist in Abuja yesterday said: “We commend the Central Bank of Nigeria for the bold step of reversing a policy that almost crippled the dairy and milk industry.
