IBADAN – Oyo State government has launched a new Park Management System (PMS) with the intention of boosting the state Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). The state’s Commissioner for Public Works, Infrastructure and Transport, Professor Raphael Afonja, who stated this while addressing newsmen, said the new PMS would include a team of Park Managers who will coordinate activities at the parks located in each of the 33 local governments, as well as two disciplinary Committees to coordinate Motor Parks and Tippers/Lorries Parks. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde, Mr Taiwo Adisa, quoted the commissioner as saying that the development was borne out of the pressing need to ensure sanity in the management of the parks. The commissioner said: “I am here to basically inform you of the recent development concerning the motor parks, garages, and quarries. We are all aware that recently, the state rolled out a plan to engage consultants that will be collecting revenue on behalf of the government, to increase our internally generated revenue in the state. “The state also decided to appoint park managers across the state through all 33 local governments, and the goal is to have these people become the eyes of government and also to collect revenue on behalf of the state government, which will be remitted through the consultants and sent to the government coffers.”
