Jodi Ewart Shadoff, no doubt has set her sight on the title in the on-going Women’s Australian Open as leads after the first round on Thursday.
Thanks to a seven-under-par 66; but the question now is she can sustain the lead and eventually winning the trophy at the end of the tournament.
This is against the backdrop that Ewart Shadoff led at the same stage of this tournament 12 months ago and eventually finished eighth.
She has represented Europe three times at the Solheim Cup, but is still to win an individual LPGA event.
The Englishwoman, 32, carded seven birdies and no bogeys as she ended the day one clear of South Korean duo Inbee Park and Jeong-eun Lee6.
England’s Georgia Hall is four back after a 70 at Royal Adelaide, alongside Stephanie Meadow of Northern Ireland.
Fellow Englishwoman Meghan MacLaren and Scotland’s Gemma Dryburgh are both on two under for the tournament.
