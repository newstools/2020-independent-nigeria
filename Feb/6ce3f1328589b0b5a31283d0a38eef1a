Yannick Carrasco has re-joined Atletico Madrid from Dalian Yifang on loan until the end of the season and Diego Simeone has not ruled out further deadline-day arrivals. The Belgium international Carrasco trained with Atletico prior to confirmation of the deal being announced on Friday and coach Simeone hopes to be able to call upon him in the LaLiga meeting with rivals Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday. The 26-year-old joined Atletico from Monaco in 2015 and left for Chinese Super League side Dalian in February 2018, but Simeone is pleased to have him back. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “[Carrasco] is excited and wants to be here,” said Simeone. “If the paperwork is done, he will certainly be with us [against Madrid]. “I want him to come with the same commitment we spoke about on the telephone. I liked Yannick’s desire to come to Atletico. That is an important step for what can happen next.”
