He urged them to recommit themselves to the progress and development of the state, bearing in mind that, they have no other home, but the state. Masari enjoined them to continue to pray for the state and the nation at large, especially, “as we are facing this difficult time of insecurity,” which he attributed to neglect of a large section of the population. He, however, maintained that, government at all levels was doing everything possible to bring the trouble makers into the main stream of society through the provision of basic needs such as education, water and health facilities. “We believe in a long time to come, we will overcome this, but of immediate need is for us to put a stop to this level of insecurity so that normalcy will return to our communities, villages and towns,” he posited. Garba earlier said they were at the Government House to appreciate Masari for all he has been doing for the indigenous Christians in the state.
