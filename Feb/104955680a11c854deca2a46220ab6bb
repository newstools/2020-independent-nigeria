Thirteen people were killed and seven injured Thursday when a bus and a truck collided on a highway in Egypt’s southern Aswan province, a health official said. Ihab Hanafy, a health ministry undersecretary, said the bodies were transferred to the morgue of a local hospital and the injured were receiving treatment. Thursday’s collision was the second road accident in Aswan in less than a week. On Tuesday, a vehicle and a truck collided on the same highway, leaving three dead and 14 injured.

The country’s official statistics agency says more than 8,000 road accidents took place in 2018, leaving over 3,000 dead and around 12,000 wounded.
