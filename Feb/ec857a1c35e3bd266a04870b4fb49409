Coronavirus fears have risked causing chaos for the Premier League, as UK clubs – including Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, and Tottenham – face huge disruptions to pre-season plans in China ahead of the 2020-2021 season. Coronavirus outbreaks in Asia are threatening to disrupt Premier League clubs’ plans for pre-season. A number of teams have frequently appeared in overseas tournaments that usually include China, and other Eastern countries, including the International Champions Cup (ICC). The ICC is the most recognisable pre-season tournament, featuring 12 of the world’s best teams. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network The competition usually includes at least one pre-season fixture in China, while last year there were also two ties in Singapore.The 2020 ICC schedule is yet to be announced, but it’s still unclear whether Asia will be able to host any matches, amid fears of the coronavirus. Manchester United and Tottenham both played in Singapore and Shanghai last summer in the ICC. Historically, Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool have all taken part in the pre-season tournament. Meanwhile, last summer, City, Wolves, Newcastle United and West Ham United were all part of the Premier League Asia Trophy. The tournament was hosted in China, spread across Shanghai and Nanjing. But, the Premier League Asia Trophy is a biennial competition, meaning there won’t be a tournament this summer. It’s also believed that at least one Premier League club has banned all business-related travel to Asia. The unnamed team has strong ties with the continent, but doesn’t want to risk infection from the coronavirus, according to the Daily Mail. The virus is already having a major impact on international sporting events. Last week, the Chinese Football Association cancelled all domestic matches until further notice.
