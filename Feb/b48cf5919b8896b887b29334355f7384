Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno has lifted the lid on how Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang responded to speculation over his future behind-closed-doors. Aubameyang and team-mate Granit Xhaka were amongst those heavily linked with exits in the January transfer window, with Barcelona reportedly weighing up a move for the prolific striker. But both players stayed put in a major boost for new manager Mikel Arteta as he aims to launch a top four charge. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network German stopper Leno was asked to assess the importance of the likes of Aubameyang and Xhaka staying in January and downplayed the impact of transfer rumours. He insists Aubameyang and Xhaka gave no indication they wanted to leave and there was no shift in mentality as the impact of Arteta’s arrival continues to manifest itself. Instead, former captain Xhaka and new skipper Aubemayang continue to “lead the team” ahead of a big few months after the winter break. Leno said: “I think not too many players talked about this. “Of course there are many rumours and other people talk about this, but you never had the feeling that any player was thinking about another club or wanted to leave or was refusing to train, or something like that, or they didn’t have the mentality in the training. “Everybody can see we have a new manager and a new mentality. We want to build something here at Arsenal. Maybe it takes a little bit of time, but of course we also want to have good results straight away now. “You can see on the pitch all these rumours [don’t affect] these players – they are fighting, they are leading the team and this is the only way.” After being held to a 0-0 draw at Burnley on Sunday, the Gunners remain 10th in the Premier League table and 10 points off fourth placed Chelsea. They will spend the winter break in Dubai before returning to action at home to Newcastle at the Emirates on Sunday, February 16.
