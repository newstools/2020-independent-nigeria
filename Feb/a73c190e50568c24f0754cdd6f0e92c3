Whatever assistance you can render to the department in this regard is highly appreciated,” he added. He also urged the traditional rulers in the area to preach against the practice of bush burning,  as it was a harbinger of fire disaster. Also, the Vice Chairman of the Gwagwalada Area Council,  Mr. Mohammed Kasim, who represented the chairman, assured that the council was prepared to make any effort and contribution that will help in fire prevention . He added that the council was already working with the traditional rulers to ensure that the anti-bush burning message was passed to those at the grassroots.
