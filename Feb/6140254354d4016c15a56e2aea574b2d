AWKA – The Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB) has argued that its leader Nnamdi Kanu did not jump bail after his arraignment at Justice Binta Nyako’s court and described those who argue in that direction as ignorant. The group, in a statement signed by the media and publicity secretary, Emma Powerful said that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu escaped because the nation’s security agents invaded his house to kill him. If he had escaped assassination at home “is it a court in Abuja, where judges are impotent, that he won’t be attacked?” they queried.  Besides, IPOB queried the likes of Garba Shehu who argued that Senator Enyinaya Abaribe ought to be in detention because Kanu jumped bail, wondering if they “are ignorant of the section of the constitution that stipulates that by law a senator is not allowed to stand surety for an accused person”, adding :”therefore, Abaribe has no case to answer, that is why neither Binta Nyako’s court nor the Court of Appeal is willing to entertain the bond forfeiture case any him longer. It said “Garba Shehu should stop disgracing himself and his Miyetti Allah government with their nauseating ignorance of judicial process,” it fumed. IPOB wondered why the Presidency is tackling Abaribe for calling on Buhari to resign saying that “This same Garba Shehu who said they don’t take advice from the likes of Abaribe were the same people that publicly called for Goodluck Jonathan to resign. “Why is it that Senator Abaribe’s legitimate call for the resignation of Abba Kyari’s government headed by Jubril Al-Sudani is suddenly treasonable felony,” it added. The group predicted that “Fulani caliphate plans against Chief Enyinnaya Abaribe and others will fail because ordinary people are now wiser thanks to the gospel of liberation being preached by our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.” It said that it is important it let the masses know that any government that failed to protect the lives and properties of her citizens is a total failure, and since this  “regime is a complete and utter failure and should be removed
