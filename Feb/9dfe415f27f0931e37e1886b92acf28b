Huawei is expected to launch its Digital Oilfield IOT Solution NIPS2020. Nigeria is one of the largest and oldest oil producers in Africa. The oil and gas sector is one of the most important sectors in the country’s economy, accounting for more than 90% of the country’s exports and 80% of the Federal Government’s revenue. The Digital Oilfield IOT Solution has been proven to help oil and gas companies to achieve 2% to 7% more yields, 5% to 9% higher recovery rate, and 5% to 20% fewer costs, which is also expected to bring growth to Nigeria oil and gas industry. Huawei Digital Oilfield IOT Solution is based on 4G LTE technology which will help the oilfield to realize the full wireless network coverage and connection of things and people. This will enable Oil and Gas companies to monitor the running efficiency of production facilities in real-time, optimize production management approaches and organizational structure, increase work efficiency, reduce labor costs, and possess strong data support for more effective decision-making. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Speaking about the launch, Huawei Nigeria Enterprise Managing Director (Abuja office), Tank Li, stated that the IoT is an essential element of digital oilfields, Huawei IOT solution can support Nigeria oil and gas companies to achieve visualized production, Efficient Collaboration, and HSE Management. All these will also help accelerate the move towards an all-digital oilfield and contribute to the digital transformation of oil and gas industries.
