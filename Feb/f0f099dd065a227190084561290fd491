The NIA stated that the industry grew at a faster pace than the economy, though penetration remains very low. Insurance penetration in Nigeria is still at it lowest ebb with unaltered 0.31per cent over the years. The reason,  according to analysts, being over concentration of the business by the operators majorly, in the urban centers. To curb the low penetration tide in the sector, National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has introduced some product, micrinsurance and takaful to enhance grassroots penetration through retail space.
