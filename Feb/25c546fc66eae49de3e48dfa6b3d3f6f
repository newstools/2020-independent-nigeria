Demola Akinwale also known as `Sypro’ on Tuesday urged the Lagos State Government{LASG} to help promote indigenous music in the state. Akinwale told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that indigenous music lacked audience and patronage. He attributed this to a lack of promotion from the record labels and stakeholders in the entertainment industry. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network “Indigenous music is gradually fading away in the country because of the lack of promotion and interest from record labels and the industry. “Everyone wants to rap or sing in foreign languages and if you are not following the trend, record labels will not be interested in your music. “And if they do not, you will not receive the adequate promotion you are supposed to get. “We must encourage artists who sing in our indigenous languages to thrive as this is one of the various ways we can showcase our music to the world. “The government can help in promoting our indigenous music by coming up with certain laws that will mandate labels, radio and television stations to promote the music on a daily basis,” he said. Akinwale advised artists to always perform live during performances. “Many musicians always mime during performances instead of performing live and this should not be the case. “Live performances showcase the talent of the artist while miming proves you are lazy. “So, artists should imbibe the culture of live performances,” he said. He urged Nigerians to always listen to indigenous music which he said are part of their cultures.
