Berkin Elvan, the 14-year-old boy shot in the head with a police tear gas canister during 2013 Gezi protests in Istanbul, was partly to blame for his own death for not taking sufficient care of his own safety, said a gendarmerie expert report presented to a Turkish court. Elvan was one of at least 11 people killed during the Gezi protests, which started as a small sit-in against the redevelopment of an Istanbul park, but quickly snowballed into the biggest anti-government demonstrations since President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Islamist party came to power in 2002. The expert report, presented to the court trying the police officer accused of killing Elvan, said the boy, who spent months in a coma before his eventual death, had “not heeded his own safety by entering the area with illegal protesters”, and was, therefore, an auxiliary to his own injury and eventual death. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network News site Diken quoted the report as saying there was a non-peaceful protest in progress on the street where Elvan was hit by the tear gas canister and said at the time protesters were throwing rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails at police. The report said that Fatih Dalgalı, the police officer on trial for the killing, was found principally at fault, but his motives could not be determined. However, it said Elvan had not hit deliberately as the police had not been aiming at specific targets. An earlier expert report by a private forensic company analyzed police cameras and found the police had dispersed protesters who were not engaged in violent acts and were not in possession of any form of weapon and said none of the demonstrators were resisting. Police cameras showed two officers taking aim before firing shots parallel to the ground, the first report said. Tear gas canisters are not meant to be fired directly at people.
