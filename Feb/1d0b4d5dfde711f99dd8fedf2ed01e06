A woman who tried to open the door of a passenger plane midway through a flight has been jailed for two years. Chloe Haines, 26, caused the Jet2 flight from the UK to Turkey to divert back to Stansted airport in June last year. She had admitted to endangering the safety of an aircraft and assaulting a member of the cabin crew. Two RAF fighter jets were scrambled to meet the plane, which had been heading to Dalaman, and escort it back to Stansted, where Haines was arrested by Essex police. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network A cabin crew member allegedly sustained scratches as she tried to prevent Haines, who was flying with her grandmother, from opening the plane door. Barrister Oliver Saxby, defending Haines, said in December: “On any analysis, she’s a troubled young person with a number of serious issues. Seventeen days before this incident she had been sentenced to a community order for not dissimilar offenses, not committed in the air but with alcohol and a loss of control. That order had not had a chance to bite.”
