Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett yesterday stopped cement entering the besieged Gaza Strip and canceled entry permits issued to hundreds of Gaza traders, Safa news agency reported. Reporting the Israeli Hebrew newspaper Maariv, Safa said that Bennett ordered the coordinator of the civil affairs in the occupied territories to carry out his directions immediately. The Gaza Strip has been under a strict Israeli siege for 13 years, which limits the entry of basic essentials including water, fuel and building materials. In 2012 the UN warned that the coastal enclave would become “uninhabitable” by 2020 as a result of the strict measures.
