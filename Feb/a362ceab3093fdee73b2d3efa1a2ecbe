Lagos – Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen has been hit with a hefty price tag of €50m as officials at his French Ligue 1 club, Lille Metropole  seek methods of holding unto him beyond this summer. With repeated media reports liking Osimhen with offers from several top clubs in England and Spain, Lille reason that they need to hold out for a big pay day if they cannot scare all the suitors away. Consequently, a report by BuzzSport indicates that the roll of suitors for Osimhen, from Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool of England, as well as Real Madrid and FC Barcelona of Spain will have to weigh their financial options heading into the summer, if they are to formally bid for the Super Eagles’ rookie. Indeed, of the lot, only Liverpool showed real intent in January, as The Reds were linked with the 21-year-old striker in a testy move last month, as they aim to get first bragging rights on the attacker, who has hit home 17 goals in all competitions for Lille so far this season. The report adds that, although Lille were in no mood to deal with any interested club during the past transfer market, they could be tempted to open to a sale this summer, providing any of the clubs said to be on the queue for Osimhen meets their asking-price. The unfolding drama comes at a point Osimhen has received the nod to feature in Sunday’s Ligue 1 fixture against Olympique Marseille, as he is said to have recovered fully from a knock he copped last weekend.
