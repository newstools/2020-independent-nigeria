LAGOS – Residents of Bariga Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in the eastern part of Lagos State have reaped what could be termed “bountiful dividends” of local government autonomy entrenched in the state. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu was in the area on Friday to inaugurate 11 road network recently completed by the council chairman, Hon. Alabi Kolade. Governor Sanwo-Olu’s intervention accelerated the completion of the 1.6-kilometre long road projects, two years after they started. The governor, accompanied by his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, and members of the State Executive Council (SEC), commissioned a state-of-the-art CMS Primary Health Centre and fully furnished three blocks of classrooms built by the council in Gbagada Girls Junior Secondary School. Sanwo-Olu said he was thrilled by the quality of the projects delivered, while paying glowing tributes to the council chairman, whom he described as a “true grassroots leader.” He said the projects were the core of social intervention programmes whose benefits to the people could not be quantified.
