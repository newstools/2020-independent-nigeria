LAGOS  – The Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents, (ANLCA) has called on the Federal Government to take urgent steps geared towards preventing Nigeria from becoming a dumping ground for empty containers. Iju Tony Nwabunike, President of the association, said this in Lagos at a media briefing. He called for urgent steps to be taken to tackle the perennial gridlock in Apapa. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Nwabunike, who recently led a team of his association’s leadership on a visit to Senator Gbemisola Saraki, the Minister of State for Transport, lauded recent moves aimed at moving containers in and out of Apapa with the use of tug propelled barges. “We wish to draw government attention to the very near possibility of making Nigeria a dumping ground for empty containers as shipping companies have shown ineptitude in taking responsibility for this. “We view the application of tug propelled barges in moving empty containers as a welcome initiative that should be improved upon” On the collection of Practitioners’ Operating Fees (POF) by the Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria (CRFFN), Nwabunike disclosed that ANLCA is supporting it because of the laudable plans explained to the association. According to him, ANLCA got convinced because they were informed that part of the funds will be deployed to build their capacity through training and retraining of it’s members.  – Nwabunike
