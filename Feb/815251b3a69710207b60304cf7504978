LAGOS – Engr. Deji Doherty, Lagos State Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has faulted the All Progressives Congress (APC) government in the state for making life difficult for ordinary people in the state. While speaking with select journalists on Tuesday, the chairman maintained that the taxation at the toll gate in Lekki axis of the state was illegal and wondered why additional taxation on a road that the tax payers had already paid for the construction. “Lagos State cannot ask Lagosians to pay tax on that road. The government cannot because it refurbished the road decide to put a toll gate there. It was not newly constructed. Development fees had already been collected from all the people along Lekki axis for the construction.

Doherty stressed that the action of the APC government was an abuse of power that was given to it by the people. He stated that there was nowhere in the world where money is paid for toll, once it is in cash, it would be termed penalty. The PDP chairman said that Lagosians were not living in jungle, maintaining that it was absurd for government to expect every resident of Lagos State to go and pay for the ticket somewhere around Lekki and collect an e-pass, and where people live outside Lekki, they would be expected to go to Victoria Island, obtain an e-pass and keep it for use anytime they would make use of the road. “Where the person fails to get the e-pass, and he uses the road, he must pay a penalty of N1,000. It is illegal, and we are going to take it legally with the authority. We are going to oppose that,” he said.
