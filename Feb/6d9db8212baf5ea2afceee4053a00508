LAGOS  – Gbenro Olajuyigbe, Executive Director, Emergency Risk Alert, has linked the crises in Nigeria and by extension Africa to leadership failure. Olajuyigbe maintained that the just-concluded 33rd African Union Summit, with the theme ‘Silencing the Gun’, was alienated from the people, because African leaders had never been concerned about the people. He stressed that the AU had remained a union of leaders and not a union of people. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network In a media programme on Monday, the expert said that leaders had been driving crisss in the continent, maintaining that African leaders had driven the people to poverty and fear to the extent that the people could no longer act on their own, even in a democracy “You cannot silence any gun if there is no freedom for want, fear and where Africans cannot act on their own behalf in terms of taking decisions. All crises emanate from violation of human rights. The environment is ripe for corruption because when you suppress them, they cannot challenge you, and the leaders become so imperial to the point that it looks like they own their lives and property, and there is no place for development.
