Lagos – Dr Samuel Nzekwe, a former President of the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), has raised concerns over the rate of Nigeria’s population explosion,  saying it portends great danger for the slow economic growth of the nation. To redress the situation, Nzekwe who spoke in Ota, Ogun State, called on the Federal Government to introduce new measures to check the rapid population growth in the country. Recall that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had predicted Nigeria’ growth rate to be 2.5 per cent while World Bank projected its growth rate in 2020 at a 2.1 just as the Trading Economics Global Macro Models and Analysts Expectation showed that the country’s population growth rate, which currently stands at 200.963 million, was likely to increase to 205.000 by the end of this first quarter.

He stated that a country experiencing population explosion amidst under production promotes social vices such as kidnapping, armed robbery and banditry among others as currently being experienced in many parts of the country. He called on the Federal Government to educate the populace on the importance of population control mechanisms to achieve sustainable economic growth and emphasised the need for girl-child education to discourage early marriages in some parts of the country. According to him, a population explosion would bring about unemployment and starvation in the country should the government failed to take immediate action to save the situation and bring births across the country under control.
