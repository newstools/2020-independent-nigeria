The UK’s licence fee will increase by £3 ($3.90) per year, as part of a pre-agreed deal struck with the country’s government. In a statement published by the BBC, it was announced that the annual television licence fee will increase from £154.50 to £157.50. The pubcaster noted that the government is responsible for setting the level of the licence fee and that it decided in 2016 that its cost would rise in line with inflation for five years from 1 April 2017. The cost of an annual black and white licence will rise from £52.00 to £53.00.

Currently, there is no impact on the free fees for over-75s, though the broadcaster had previously announced controversial plans to scrap the benefit. In December, prime minister Boris Johnson launched a review into non-payment of the TV licence fee, with critics suggesting it should be replaced by an SVOD-style payment mechanism. Last week, Julian Knight – who is in favour of licence fee reform – was elected chair of the government’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS).
