LAGOS – Prof Kingsley Moghalu, former deputy governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has stated that the manufacturing sector have not been given the boost it deserves which is why the sector accounts for only 10 percent contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Moghalu, who made the remark during a media programme in Lagos Yesterday, maintained that there was nowhere in the world where development had happened without significant push from government in the manufacturing sector. He stressed that most manufacturing companies like the ones in Nnewi operate without government’s intervention, which was why some of them had gone back to trading.

A lot of agriculture in Nigeria is subsistence agriculture, which may not have the value chain. We need to have 30 percent of our GDP from manufacturing, because a classical definition of economic transformation is when a country moves away from dependence on agriculture for most of its GDP” The former Deputy Governor of CBN, maintained that over centralisation of power at the centre had to a great extent affected the nation’s development. He said that all decisions were made in Abuja, and most decisions were bout Lagos, neglecting other industrial areas like, Nnewi, Aba, kano Port Harcourt etcetera. He said that unless there was restructuring at regional and State levels there might not be much impact, stressing that the nature of Nigeria economy had prioritised crude oil, where people were only paying lip service to industrialisation.
