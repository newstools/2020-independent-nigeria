Manchester United have been linked with Aaron Ramsey, Jack Grealish and James Maddison ahead of the summer transfer window. Manchester United have been backed to sign Juventus star Aaron Ramsey by former Chelsea man Tony Cascarino. That’s despite the club planning to swoop for James Maddison or Jack Grealish come the end of the season. Manchester United have been linked with Ramsey at a time where he’s struggling for Juventus. The Wales international is in his first campaign with the Old Lady but found game time tough to come by, managing just 12 Serie A appearances. Ramsey has found the net just once for Juventus and his struggles have sparked talk of a return to the Premier League. And Cascarino believes the 29-year-old would suit United if he were to leave Serie A behind. “Ramsey would be the perfect fit for United,” he wrote in his column for The Times. “Ramsey played in Juventus’ defeat away to Verona on Saturday but it was fairly typical of his first season in Italy as he came on as a substitute and didn’t have an impact on the game. “I can see the former Arsenal man back in the Premier League next season. “Reports linking him to Manchester United make a lot of sense as he is the sort of player they need – a proven midfielder with goalscoring pedigree and plenty of Premier League experience. “I could see him not costing too much, with Juventus possibly settling for £20 million as that would get them most of their outlay back.” United have already signed one goalscoring midfielder in the form of Bruno Fernandes. But the club are understood to be planning a swoop for a similar player of the Portuguese’s calibre this summer. Jack Grealish is being eyed amid his fine form for Aston Villa this season.
