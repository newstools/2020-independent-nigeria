A woman was dragged out of a Chinese supermarket and pinned to the ground after allegedly refusing to wear a face mask while the country deals with the coronavirus outbreak. Mobile phone footage from Wednesday shows the shopper, identified only by her surname Qiu, resisting two uniformed officers as they haul her down the aisle of Space supermarket in Shenzen, in south China’s Guangdong province. The local government, responsible for some 113million inhabitants, announced a province-wide mask order effective on January 26, making it a punishable offence to be in a public space without a surgical mask. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Qiu, 51, reportedly refused to comply with the temporary law aimed at stopping the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, which has killed 305 people and infected nearly 10,000 in mainland China. The video shows her kicking arresting police officers as they tie her hands behind her back and pin her to the floor in front of witnesses. The authorities said Qiu was taken to Kangning Hospital, which confirmed she was not infected with the coronavirus. She was to be discharged and handed back to Shenzhen police for further questioning, but it was not immediately clear whether she would be jailed for refusing to wear a surgical mask. A Space supermarket spokesperson told local media that all their shops are being disinfected once every two hours amid concerns over the pneumonia-like outbreak. Video below: Daily Mail
