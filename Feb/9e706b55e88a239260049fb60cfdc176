LAGOS – The Lagos State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has pleaded with the Federal Government and Christians to save the nation from total collapse. Apostle Alexander Bamgbola, the chairman of Lagos State chapter of CAN, who is also the overseer of Zion the City of The Lord Ministries, in Lagos, said this at a briefing ahead of the Interdenominational Divine Service (IDDS) holding Saturday, February 15 at Shepherdhill Baptist Church, Obanikoro, Lagos. He noted that the upsurge in unemployment and insecurity in Nigeria, called for great concern. Powered by RubiQube Ad Network Bamgbola, who prayed that the youths would not explode soon due to frustration, expressed pity that Nigeria was way behind as it ought to be in the league of developed countries, adding that there was the need to salvage the country and make it safe for more investors. He stated, “Our government, the Federal Government, has to rise up and deal with insecurity in our nation; this is so important. With insecurity, the country can never make any progress. That is why we have to pray more and the Lord will intervene. “Nigeria is a great nation by any standard; this is not the way it should be in 2020, we ought to look like England, Germany, South Korea and other developed nations. We need to progress, we have the largest number of youths per population in the whole world. “Our leaders should be having sleepless nights when you look at the number of unemployed youths in our nation; it is like we are joking with this force. We are praying that the youths will not explode and bring down this nation themselves because they are fed up.” Continuing, he said: “They go to university but are not guaranteed a job, you see people, five to ten years without a job, that’s why we have to deal with insecurity and let there be peace in our nation so that so we can attract foreign investment where there will be good employment, which will contribute to the welfare of the people.”
