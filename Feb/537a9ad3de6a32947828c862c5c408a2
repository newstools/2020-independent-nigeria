BENIN – Charles Idahosa, a former political adviser to former governor of Edo State, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has faulted claims in some quarters suggesting that the wish of Oshiomhole, the national Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), would prevail in Edo APC governorship primary. Idahosa insisted that Edo State 2020 governorship election would determine the survival or extinction of the party in the state. He made the declaration when Edo APC Local Government Chairmen’s Forum paid him a solidarity visit at his Benin City home, where he described his purported suspension by a faction of the party as another wise goose chase Powered by RubiQube Ad Network According to him, “There is no cause for alarm…Don’t be bothered or shaken, Obaseki must do his eight years. If anybody by omission or commission stops him, APC is dead in Edo State. I have said it many times and I want the powers that be to understand this. “For those who benevolence spirits cracked their palm kernel for them should not think they are God. “You (APC Local Government Chairmen) do not talk from both sides of the mouth because you have a gift of the gap,” he said. The Edo APC chieftain from Uhunmwode Local Government Area of the State, boasted that Governor Godwin Obaseki would defeat the four APC contenders in the forthcoming governorship election, having made them to kiss the dust in the state APC governorship primary in 2016.
