ABUJA – A non-governmental group, Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in Diaspora (AESID) has condemned a recent viral video of a truckload of rice purportedly sent by the Ebonyi State government to Human Rights Radio, Abuja. The group expressed shock and displeasure at the incident in which the items said to be meant for a serving Federal Director as Christmas largesse was mistakenly tak­en to the radio station. In the video, the distressed driver of the truck who con­veyed the items from the state capital in Abakiliki was seen lamenting that his payment for the delivery was stalled be­cause he delivered the rice to the wrong address.

A situation that made the Head of the radio station, Ahmed Isah to promise to buy up the goods if the state government comes up to make a claim. Isah popularly called “Ordi­nary President” offered to pay the driver N50, 000 for the deliv­ery and expressed disappoint­ment in the state government gift of 300 bags of branded 25kg rice to just one rich individual when poor civil servants in the state are living in abject poverty.

Pascal Oluchukwu said his group is troubled by what he described as “uncommon but shameful Father Christmas behaviour of Ebonyi State Governor, Engr. David Umahi and his aides.” The group said the action has betrayed every logic of compassion “How Ebonyi State government would give out less than 5kg bags of rice per two civil servants in some cases and one bag of the same less than 5kg in others to its workers but sent a massive 300 bags of rice to just a single Director in the Federal Civil service who ordinarily can afford what to eat this yuletide. “We also recall that the same Governor Umahi promised civil servants N10, 000 each as their Christmas bonus. We reliably gathered is yet to be redeemed as at the time of going to press. “Yet, the greedy and over-am­bitious Umahi is expending our limited resources on those who may not have a need for it just to curry the favour of the northern oligarchy in his new defection enterprise.” SHOCKING!
