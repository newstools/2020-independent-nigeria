Arsenal left-back Sead Kolasinac wants to return to Schalke and has agreed personal terms over a loan deal until the end of the season, football.london understands. The former Schalke midfielder will return to Gelsenkirchen after leaving in 2017 to join the Gunners, and will be hopeful of saving the Bundesliga side from relegation where they currently languish at the bottom of the German top flight. Kolasinac, 27, was close to joining Bayer Leverkusen on transfer deadline day earlier in the year but a move fell through and it was widely expected that he would leave in January or the summer, with his contract up June 2022.

Bosnian international Kolasinac made 78 appearances and scored twice for Arsenal since arriving on a free transfer from Schalke, but has found his game time limited this season due to the emergence of Kieran Tierney. There is no obligation to buy included in the deal and football.london understands that Arsenal will be covering a portion of Kolasinac’s salary due to the financial struggles Schalke are currently enduring. FCT Minister Commends Police Officers For Securing Abuja Nigerians Must Look Forward To Prosperous 2021 – Makinde Gunners legend Ian Wright recently questioned the decision to play Kolasinac and fellow wantaway defender Shkodran Mustafi in the Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat to Manchester City. “Why are you playing people like Kolasinac? Why are you playing someone like Mustafi? I’d rather see [William] Saliba who is playing in the Under-23s, I’d rather see Smith Rowe and I’d rather see something different,” said Wright. “‘I would say to the people upstairs: give Mesut Ozil the money if you’re not going to play him and move him on. Same with Kolasinac and same with those players that are in and around the club and aren’t going to contribute. “‘That’s what he needs, players who are contributing. Arsenal have to realise they’re in a situation that can get worse and if they do lose those games against Brighton and West Brom… those games are must-win games.’” Several Arsenal players are expected to leave the club in January and over the summer with Mesut Ozil, Sokratis, Mustafi and David Luiz all on contracts which expire in less than six months time.
