ABUJA-The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) through the Ministerial Task Force on COVID-19 has warned shop owners to simply comply with COVID-19 guidelines or have their business premises shut to prevent further spread of the deadly virus. Speaking on behalf of the task team, the Head, Media and Public Enlightenment Comrade Ikharo Attah gave this warning while monitoring compliance in some shopping malls and business premises across the city, however advised them to go for the former rather than hamper their business activities. Ikharo hinted that the FCTA would “not hesitate to shut down shopping malls, Maitama farmers’ market and business premises in the city that fail to comply with the covid-19 protocols and guidelines.

The health protocols are for all to observe” , he stated.

He, however, revealed that at the Maitama Farmers’ market, his taskforce observed strong disregard for the protocols as most people were not wearing facemasks and there was only one washing point at the market. Three persons were therefore arrested at the market as the taskforce vowed it would shut it down on a next visit if the violations persisted. Other places visited were the Jabi Lake Mall, Novera Shoprite Mall along the Nnamdi Azikiwi International Airport road and some business premises at Wuse and Maitama Districts. SHOCKING!
