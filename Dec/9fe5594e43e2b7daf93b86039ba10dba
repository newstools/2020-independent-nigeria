Famous Turkish comedian Metin Akpınar, 79, appeared in an İstanbul court on Wednesday on charges of insulting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, according to Turkish media reports. Akpınar and another Turkish comedian, Müjdat Gezen, face up to four years, eight months in prison each due to remarks they made about fascism during a program on Halk TV in 2018. The first hearing in the comedians’ trial took place at the Anadolu 8th Penal Court of First Instance in İstanbul on Wednesday. Gezen, who did not attend the hearing, was represented by his lawyers, while Akpınar made a statement in court and denied the insult charges.
