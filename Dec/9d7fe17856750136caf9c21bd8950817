European stocks dropped in thin trading on the final trading day of a rollercoaster year that will leave the region’s main benchmark short of recouping all its losses from the pandemic. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.4% at 8:15 a.m. in London, taking its annual decline to 4.1%. The volume of trading in the final shortened session ahead of the New Year’s day holiday was less than half the 30-day average, with many markets closed for New Year’s eve including Germany, Switzerland and Italy. European shares have rebounded from the almost seven-year low reached in March, first boosted by broad stimulus measures, and later by optimism that coronavirus vaccines will help restore economic normalcy. Greater political clarity also helped risk assets, following the U.S. election and a Brexit deal.

The unique nature of the pandemic also hurt travel and leisure shares and service-oriented industries, while boosting stay-at-home trades.
