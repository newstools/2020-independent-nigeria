President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has felicitated with the Christian faithful as they celebrate Christmas. Lawan in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Ola Awoniyi on Thursday in Abuja, said the 2020 celebration came at a time when the world was combatting the resurgence of the Coronavirus pandemic. He said the pandemic had forced many countries to ramp up health safety protocols at a time when people traditionally gathered to share love in celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.

He said the National Assembly, particularly the senate was in consultation with relevant agencies to ensure that due diligence was followed in procurement and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine when available. This he said, was to ensure that all Nigerians had equitable access to inoculation against the stubborn virus. Lawan urged Nigerians to celebrate the festival responsibly by adhering strictly to public health protocols as announced by the PTF to curtail spread of the virus. SHOCKING!
