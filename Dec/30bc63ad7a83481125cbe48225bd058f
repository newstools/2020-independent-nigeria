DON'T BE A VICTIM! “It is so pathetic that some unscrupulous elements, under whichever guises, seem to have determined to make our nation unlikeable. “It was so disheartening when the news about gruesome murder of 43 rice farmers at Kwashebe allegedly perpetrated by Boko Haram insurgents in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State filtered into the public. While the nation was still mourning the sad event, the unfortunate news of kidnapping of about 333 children of All-Boys Government Science Secondary School in northwestern Katsina State was aired.

This crime and other crimes allegedly carried out by criminal organisations negate all human principles and moral values and stand in contradiction to the clear teachings of any ideal or ethical standards. “As a Mother, I am deeply touched by the state of the kidnapped children and the family left behind by the rice farmers killed in their farms. Killing in the name of any religion or tribe is totally condemnable, and such act should not be condoned within the society. “We, therefore, urged the Federal Government to set up its game to ensure that security of lives and properties is paramount to the government. It is through this that all the strides of government in reflating the nation’s economy could become a reality.” She said. Mrs Onigbogi also noted the renewed surge of COVID 19, saying that the surge of the pandemic should be taken with all seriousness by adhering to all health advisory including social distancing, regular hand washing and social distancing.
