P/HARCOURT – The Commissioner of Po­lice, Rivers State Command, Joseph Mukan, has recom­mended that a psychological test be conducted on officers and men of the command to evaluate their mental state. The recommendation came days after a father of five, Jimoh Abiodun, was shot dead by an alleged drunken police officer for possessing an I-Phone at Elelewo area of the state. More than five citi­zens have been killed by the police in cold blood in Decem­ber alone in the state. Mukan expressed worry over the incessant misuse of firearms by police officers in the command following a public outcry over killings of residents. He disclosed this during a meeting with Di­visional Police Officers and Heads of Tactical Units, in­cluding Inspectors and Rank and File of the Command.
