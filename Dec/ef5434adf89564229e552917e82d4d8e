LAGOS – The Lagos State police com­mand on Tuesday said it had beefed up security around churches, mosques and pub­lic installations across the state over alleged planned bombing of federal and state facilities by a yet to be iden­tified terrorist group. Recall that the Depart­ment of State Services (DSS) had, on Tuesday, alerted Nigerians on plans by “en­emies of state” to unleash terror on vulnerable places, including critical infrastruc­ture, places of worship, as well as recreational centres during the Christmas and New Year celebrations. It claimed that the plot would be executed through the use of explosives, sui­cide bombing, and other weapons.

We have also taken steps to ensure that lives and property of those residing in the state are secured. “We advise everybody to go about their duty without any fear of attack, harass­ment, or molestation. “Aside, we are also aware that mischief makers use the same antics to cause tension. “We have deployed cut­ting edge technology to mon­itor movement of people in and out of Lagos. “We would also advise parents and guardians to warn their wards to stay away from trouble-prone ar­eas because anyone arrested for causing mayhem in any part of the state would be made to face the wrath of the law,” he said. “Parents and guardians are advised to warn their children to desist from the use of fireworks or firecrack­ers as the laws banning their usage are still in place,” he added. Odumosu, who also said the command would not tol­erate attacks on policemen by thugs and commercial motorcycle riders, warned that any such plans would be vehemently resisted. “Considering the securi­ty situation in the country, driving without vehicle number plate fixed in front and behind and the use of tinted vehicles is outlawed. “More plain cloth police­men have been deployed to criminal-prone areas. “The 12a.m to 4a.m cur­few is still being enforced,” he said.
