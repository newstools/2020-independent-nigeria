Seun Kuti is the leader of Nigeria Resistance Move­ment (NRM) and one of the promoters of the Move­ment of the People (MOP), a fledgling political organisa­tion of youths and Nigerian masses, mobilising citizens for future political activi­ties in the country. His residence, since Fri­day, had reportedly been an object of police siege, during which a member of his household was taken away. One of the close associ­ates of Seun Kuti told Dai­ly Independet on Monday that he and members of the MOP legal team would be visiting the police authori­ties at Panti to find out why he and his household had been under siege. The source, one of the leaders of the MOP, who pleaded anonymity, said that Seun Kuti, would also be accompanied by mem­bers of the organisation and activist communities he belongs to, as well as some pro-democracy groups. He said, “We want to see the police authorities in Panti to know why they are looking for Seun. “The police said they were reacting to allega­tions in social media that he was threatening peo­ple with firearms, which sound funny. “The MOP media team and our members, activists and pro-democracy groups will also be part of the vis­itation team to the police. “We want to enquire why he is being harassed and reasons for the siege to his residence. After we have seen them in Panti, we will know what further steps to take.” SHOCKING!
