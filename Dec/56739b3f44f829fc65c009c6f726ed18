The source also disclosed that the signing ceremony has been scheduled in the president’s schedule. The presidential assent, which is coming on the eve of 2021, is expected to herald robust economic activities in the New Year despite the effects of COVID-19 and the ensuing downturn in oil prices which is believed to have plunged the country into recession.

Recall that the upper chamber of the National As­sembly recently passed the budget estimates but shored it up from the N13.08 trillion originally presented by Pres­ident Buhari in October 2020 to N13. 588 trillion. Part of the excuse ad­duced for increasing the budget was the late receipt of spending from the exec­utive. According to the Senate, there was the late receipt of spending request for the up­scaling of the National So­cial Investment Programme (NSIP) from the executive amounting to N365 billion, in addition to the discovery of under projection of the total revenue to the tune of N100 billion. Meanwhile, in the bud­get breakdown, a total of N496.528 billion was ap­proved for statutory trans­fer, including an approval of N3.324 trillion for debt servicing. A further breakdown re­vealed that N4.125 trillion would go into capital expen­ditures while N5.641 trillion is earmarked for recurrent expenditure. The price of the nation’s main revenue earner, crude oil, was benchmarked at $40 per barrel, with daily crude oil production projected at 1.86mbpd; exchange rate was fixed at N379/$, and gross domestic production (GDP) growth rate pegged at 3.00 percent. According to the leader­ship of the National Assem­bly, N5.196 trillion was ear­marked as a deficit, which would be financed by some multilateral and bilateral project-tied loans worth N709 billion.
