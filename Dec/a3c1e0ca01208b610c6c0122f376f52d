The monarch before giv­ing the Ibadan born boxer a royal blessing recalled his winning mentality during his youth’s days as a young boxer in Ebutte area Lagos and shared some boxing tech­niques that could enhance victory for the Nigerian. “Boxing is spiritual, only those who are engaged in the ring can understand that. Footwork was my strength in my boxing days and it had helped me against most of my opponents. You will need to keep your feet apart as you move to maintain good balance, and move round the ring using short sliding steps on the balls of your feet while you always ensure to move the foot closest to the direction in which you want to move first,” Alaafin explained to Scorpion.
