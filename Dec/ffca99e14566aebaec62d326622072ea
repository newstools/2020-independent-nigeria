A health worker at a hospital in the U.S. state of Wisconsin was fired after deliberately leaving more than 500 doses of COVID-19 vaccine unrefrigerated for too long, according to reports. The Aurora Medical Centre in Grafton said it had to discard some 50 vials of Moderna vaccine, each containing 10 doses, after they had been kept out of a refrigerator overnight. An initial inquiry led Aurora to believe this was a case of “unintended human error,” but the worker admitted on Wednesday to having unfrozen the vaccine on purpose, according to a statement.
