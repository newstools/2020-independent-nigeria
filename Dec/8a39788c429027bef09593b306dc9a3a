ABUJA – The Core All Pro­gressives Congress Supporters Network (Co-APC-SuN) has demanded the immediate resignation of Senator Ahmed Lawan as Senate President over alleged im­peachment plot by some members of the National Assembly against President Muhammadu Buhari. The APC group alleged on Monday, that the Senate President, former Borno State governor, Senator Kashim Shettima and Sen­ators from the opposition political parties, should be investigated over the alle­gation. A statement by Alhaji Bala Abubakar, Publicity Secretary of Co-APC-SuN, accused some members of the APC of aligning forces with the opposition ele­ments to “selfishly exploit” the mandate of the APC in their custody.

Lawan, together with everyone mentioned in the plot to unseat President Bu­hari. “Anywhere, a shadow of such satanic plots is noticed, we shall take the necessary actions to crush it instanta­neously,” Abubakar stated.
