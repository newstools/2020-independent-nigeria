The Thai Commerce Ministry forecasts the country’s exports will grow 4 percent to over 238 billion USD in 2021. Pimchanok Vonkorpon, director-general of the ministry’s Trade Policy and Strategy Office said next year’s growth would be driven largely by food, products related to working from home, home appliances, healthcare, the recovering global economy and the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine. “Despite a second wave of infections reported by many trading partners, their lockdown measures are not as tight as during the first wave of the outbreak to curb the impact on overall economies,” said Pimchanok. “A successful vaccine would build up confidence in the world’s economic prospects from the second quarter.” EXPOSED - HOW LAGOS DOCTOR DISCOVERED MAJOR REASONS WHY MOST WIVES NOW HEAVILY CHEATS ON THEIR HUSBANDS AND THE PERMANENT SECRET TO SEXUALLY SATISFYING THEIR WIVES.
