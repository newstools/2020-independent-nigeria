UGHELI – A group, Movement for the Survival of Itsekiri Ethnic Nationality (MOSIEN), has told the Itsekiri influential leaders that allegedly ceded the Warri North Local Government Council chairman­ship seat to the Ijaw to discussed ways in which some Itsekiri, whose houses were destroyed during the communal crises between the Ijaw and Itsekiri would live without threat to their life and property. MOSIEN, in a statement signed by Chief Robinson Ariyo, National Chair­man, Prince Clement Omotoye, Nation­al Secretary, and Moses Oritsetimeyin Otaru, National P.R.O, also accused the Itsekiri political leaders of ceding the Warri North Local Government Coun­cil seat to the Ijaw in exchange for the 2023 Delta South Senatorial seat. They pointed out that some of the Itsekiri towns were yet under siege as indigenes of the communities were itching to go back to their towns and villages, but there were still threats that all the towns have been captured and no Itsekiri dared go back to occupy them.
