England defender Kieran Trippier, who played every minute of Atletico Madrid’s La Liga and Champions League games this season, has been handed a 10-week ban for breaching the English Football Association (FA) ‘s betting regulations. “An independent regulatory commission was appointed to hear the case, with four of the alleged breaches found proven and three dismissed during a subsequent personal hearing,” read a statement. “The independent regulatory commission’s written reasons for its decisions and the associated sanction will be published in due course,” it added.

The FA did not specify what the breach was but revealed that it had occurred in July 2019. Meanwhile, Trippier has denied all the allegations and has insisted that he did not place any bets himself or profit from bets made by other people. “I can’t speak about anything about the FA case, but I’m just thinking positive,” Trippier was quoted by the Guardian back in November.

Atletico reacted to the latest development with outrage, pointing out that the FA had not directly informed them about the ban and that they would continue to the 30-year-old for their forthcoming fixtures. “I can’t speak about anything about the FA case, but I’m just thinking positive,” Trippier was quoted as saying by the Guardian back in November. “I’m just concentrating on my football and trying to give my all like I’ve done throughout my whole career. My love’s always been there, and it always will be. I love coming away with England at every opportunity, so my thought is just enjoying my football,” he added. Trippier’s ban follows that of former England and Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge also for breaching the FA’s gambling rules. Sturridge was slapped with by four-month worldwide suspension that has prematurely ended his time with the Turkish side Trabzonspor. SHOCKING!
