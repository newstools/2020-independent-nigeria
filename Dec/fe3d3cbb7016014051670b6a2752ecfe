Former Dundee United manager Jim McLean, who famously masterminded victories over Barcelona and Borussia Moenchengladbach on the way to the 1987 Uefa Cup final, has died at the age of 83. McLean guided Scottish Premiership side United to their only Scottish top-flight title in 1983 and helped the club challenge the dominance of Glasgow sides Celtic and Rangers, a feat he described as “a corner shop taking on Marks and Spencer”. McLean took players such as Paul Sturrock, Paul Hegarty, Dave Narey, Richard Gough and Maurice Malpas and turned them into household names across the country and heroes for the Scotland national side.
