The Youth Wing of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) has berated the All Progressive Congress (APC) Acting Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, over comment that a North-West governor is behind the heightened cases of banditry, abductions and other violent crimes in that zone. The group recalled that Nabena who recently made the allegation in a statement, urged the security agencies to launch investigation into an intelligence report, which it claimed indicted the governor even though he did not name the governor and the state. While reacting to the claims, the Youth Wing of SOKAPU observed with sadness the deliberate silence of the Department of State Services (DSS) over Nabena’s statement as against what the secret police did when the former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia, made similar disclosure in August this year.

According to the group, “Mailafia had disclosed during a radio interview some months ago that a current Northern governor is one of the commanders of Boko Haram and behind the increasing acts of insurgency and banditry ravaging the North. In the statement by the National Youth Leader of SOKAPU, John Isaac said it is disturbing to note that Nabena’s statement does not seem to threaten national security as the DSS suggested of Dr. Mailafia’s disclosure.

While we the youths and people of Southern Kaduna believe the DSS has a responsibility of protecting national security, we also believe this responsibility must be pursued responsibly. “We, therefore, demand that the DSS henceforth desist from this continued distraction, harassment and selective witch-hunting of a law-abiding and a quintessential patriot in the person of Dr. Mailafia who is known for his selfless love and patriotism.” “The DSS should, instead, concentrate on intelligence gathering in curbing and addressing the security challenges facing the North,” he said.
