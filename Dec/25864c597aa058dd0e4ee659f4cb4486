Similar­ly, default on total unsecured loans to households and an overdraft/personal loans to households is expected to lower in Q1 2021. The report also confirmed that credit conditions in the corporate sector vary by size of the business as the survey asked lenders to re­port developments in the corporate sector by large and medium-size public non-financial corporations (PNFCs), open-ended fund companies (OFCs) and small businesses. The overall availability of credit to the corporate sector increased in Q4 2020 and is expected to increase in Q1 2021.This was driven by changing sector-specific risks, market share objec­tives, changing appetite for risk, changing economic conditions and changing li­quidity conditions.

Availability of credit in­creased for all business sizes in Q4 2020, while the same trend is expected in Q1 2021. Spreads between bank lending rates and MPR on approved new loan applica­tions widened for all firm sizes except medium PNFCs in the period under review. Lenders expect spread on bank lending rates and MPR on approved new loan applications to also widen for all firms sizes except for medium PNFC, which is ex­pected to remain unchanged Q1 2021. The proportion of loan applications approved for all business sizes increased in Q4 2020 and were expected to further increase in Q1 2021. Lenders required stron­ger loan covenants from all firm sizes in both Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. Fees/commissions on ap­proved new loan applications decreased for small business, remained unchanged for me­dium PNFCs and increased for large PNFCs and OFCs in Q4 2020. Lenders of all sized business expect fees/com­missions on approved new loan applications to rise in Q1 2021. All firm sizes benefit­ted from an increase in maximum credit lines on approved new loan appli­cations in Q4 2020 and are expected to benefit from an increase in maximum credit lines on approved new loan applications in Q1 2021.
