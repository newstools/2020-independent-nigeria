ENUGU – It was a show of unreserved tears of joy as little Miss Blessing Sun­day Odii, aged 15, who went miss­ing in November 2020 was found by Miss Deborah Ndidiamaka Eneh. Blessing was miraculously re­united with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Sunday Odii and other fam­ily members, at the State Head­quarters of Enugu State Police Command on December 22, 2020. Mr. Daniel Ndukwe, Police Public Relation Officer of Enu­gu State Command Daniel Nduk­we on Thursday said Available reports show that the teenager, said to be defective in speech, got missing last month after leaving her mother’s shop at Garriki, Awkunanaw, Enugu, to an un­known destination.

However, all frantic efforts made by her parents to locate her whereabouts proved abortive. “Interestingly, providence smiled on her when she was found in New Haven area of Enugu by the Good Samaritan, Miss Eneh, who took her home and was supported by her elder sister, Mrs. Ikechi Odu and her husband, Mr. Jonathan Odu, to cater for her pending when she is properly identified and claimed by her parents or relatives. This was after they had reported the situation at both New Haven Po­lice Station and Ministry of Gen­der Affairs.

And like the unrestrained attraction of a metal to a magnet, mother and daughter found them­selves uncontrollably hugging each other with a free flow of tears of joy, following their over one month period of portentous separation. This left on-lookers at the Headquarters in awe,” he said. The Commissioner of Police, CP Ahmad AbdurRahman, laud­ed the humanitarian and chari­table disposition of Miss Edeh and Mr./Mrs. Jonathan Odu to the missing but now found and reunited Little Miss Blessing, describing it as “an uncommon show of compassion and char­ity.” He further enjoined residents of the state to take a cue from these Good Samaritans and be not weary in loving and caring for people in need and distress, like the teenager.
