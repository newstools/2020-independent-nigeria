Edo people, irrespective of their political affiliation have been enjoined to continuously support the duo of Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Hon Philip Shaibu, as they strive to transform the state into a major economic hub in the shortest possible time. Hon. Henry Duke Tenebe, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Edo State, who made the call while speaking to journalists in Benin reaffirmed his believe in the capability of Obaseki and his deputy, Shaibu, to deliver on their electoral promises.

Gov Obaseki and Shaibu are helping to realise the dreams of an average Edo indigene, whether at home or in diaspora. What is required of Edo people is to support him in this onerous task so that our dear state can regain her lost glory”, he asserted. Hon Tenebe also “commended the PDP hierarchy in the state, led by its indefatigable state chairman, Dr Aziegbemi, for rendering support to the state government at a crucial moment like this, stressing that all hands must be on deck in the struggle to improve the living conditions of the people of Edo State.” He similarly urged the PDP members to rally round the governor in his onerous mission of taking Edo to a greater height.
