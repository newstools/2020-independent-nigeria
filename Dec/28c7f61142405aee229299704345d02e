Arsenal are back in action this evening when they take on Manchester City in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals. The Gunners’ cup form has been the shining light on their otherwise disappointing season. Mikel Arteta’s men are currently 15th in the Premier League but they won their Europa League group with a 100% record and could still reach the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup with what would be a surprise win over Pep Guardiola’s men this evening. Arsenal are on a run of seven Premier League games without a win, leaving Arteta under real pressure despite being early in his reign as Gunners boss.
