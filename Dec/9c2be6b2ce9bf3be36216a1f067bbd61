The Vice Chancellor was full of appreciation for the media men for the support they gave his administration all through the five years through positive coverage and constructive criticisms. He charged them to continue the same support for the incoming administration. The Coordinator, CIPPR, Mr Ademola Adekoya, in his welcome address praised the Vice Chancellor for his tireless support for the Media Parley describing him as the number one PR Officer of the University.

This year’s Media Parley and Awards is the 4th edition of the ceremony and the last under the Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun Administration. It is worthy of note that the creativity, ingenuity, tact and media friendliness of the Centre for Information, Press and Public Relations (CIPPR) unit of LASU under the able leadership of Mr. Martins Ademola Adekoya, his lieutenant Olaniyi Jenriogbe (Jerry) and the other highly supportive members of the image- laundering team contributed immensely to the all-round success of the outgoing Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun who has massively transformed the outlook of the university, resulting in its astronomical image flight via the scrutinising reportage of the education-slanted Nigerian media.
