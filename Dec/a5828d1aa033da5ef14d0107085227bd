AWKA – The Senator representing Anambra-Central Senatorial District, Uche Ekwunife, has charged her constituents to hold Governor Willie Obiano accountable for provision of critical infrastructure in their communities. Ekwunife offered the ad­vice at the weekend during her briefing of stakeholders in Anambra Central District on her achievements since going to the Senate. She spoke as she addressed people of Awka-North Local Council Area who com­plained bitterly that the Ama­sea-Oba Ofemili Road, which was started by Governor Pe­ter Obi, was yet to be complet­ed thereby leaving their area inaccessible.
