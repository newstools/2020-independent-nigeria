ABUJA – The Federal Govern­ment has urged re­ligious leaders in the country to re­frain from stoking the em­bers of hatred and disunity, warning that resorting to scorched-earth rhetoric at this time could trigger un­intended consequences. It noted that instigating regime change outside the ballot box is not only un­constitutional, but also an open call to anarchy. “While religious lead­ers have a responsibility to speak truth to power, such truth must not come wrapped in anger, hatred, disunity and religious disharmony,” Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture, said in a statement issued in Lagos on Saturday.

He said it is particular­ly graceless and impious for any religious leader to use the period of Christ­mas, a season of peace, to stoke the embers of hatred, sectarian strife and national disunity. ”Calling for a violent overthrow of a demo­cratically-elected gov­ernment, no matter how disguised such a call is, and casting a particular religion as violent is not what any religious leader should engage in, and cer­tainly not in a season of peace,” Mohammed said, adding that instigating regime change outside the ballot box is not only unconstitutional but also an open call to anarchy.

The minister said what­ever challenges Nigeria may be going through at this moment can only be tackled when all leaders and indeed all Nigerians come together, not when some people arrogantly engage in name-calling and finger-pointing.
