Algeria will launch Covid-19 vaccinations in January, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune said Sunday, although the country has not yet selected which vaccine it will deploy. Tebboune, who is recovering from Covid-19 in Germany, where he was hospitalised on October 28, made the announcement on Twitter. He said he had tasked Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad to convene without delay a meeting of the country’s specialist Covid-19 science committee with a view to choosing an “adequate vaccine”. In Algeria, people with Covid-19 are given hydroxychloroquine among other treatments, despite a raft of studies showing it is ineffective.
