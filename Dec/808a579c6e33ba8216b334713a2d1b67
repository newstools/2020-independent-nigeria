LAGOS – Comrade Timi Frank, po­litical activist and former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC) on Monday, gave the Fed­eral Government a 14-day ultimatum to rescind the appointment of a Sole Ad­ministrator for the Niger Delta Development Com­mission (NDDC), or face legal action. Frank, in a statement, insisted that the defence put up by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, for ap­pointing his cousin, Effiong Akwa, as the new helmsman of the NDDC, was an insult to the people of the region. He warned the Federal Government to immediate­ly nominate a substantive board for the NDDC as pro­vided for in its establish­ment Act, or face massive street protests in the region as well as a law suit after the expiration of the ulti­matum.

Frank described Akpa­bio’s claim that Sole Admin­istrators had overseen the affairs of the intervention agency in the past as unten­able, saying, “illegality 20 years ago remains illegality today and tomorrow.” The Bayelsa-born politi­cal activist insisted that that no law said that a statutory board of the NDDC could not be in place, while Akpabio had been carrying out what he termed a phony forensic audit at the commission.
