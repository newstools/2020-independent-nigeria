ROLAND OGBONNAYA JUSTINA OKPANKU LAGOS  – Artists of different shades joined friends, family and associates of the Director-General of the National Council of Art and Culture (NCAC), Otunba Olusegun Runsewe whose mother was laid to rest in Lagos last Friday. Interestingly, Nigerian arts and crafts were on showcase at the Eagle Club, Surulere, venue of the post interment reception of Mrs Felicia Adesola Runsewe also known as Mama Kaduna.

The expansive venue was decorated with various indigenous artworks made from local art materials carefully blended with local fabrics, which showcased the entrepreneurial skills in interior and exterior decorations. On arrival, guests were excited to explore the artworks. A canoe fully captured in a row mission flanked by a dummy of the iconic Eyo Masquerade at the entrance to the hall was a cynosure of attention.

The musical concert performed by the Nigerian Fuji minstrel Sir Shina Peters was the talk of the town. The ambience of the 3,000-sitting capacity Eagle Club hall, no doubt, also added its own flavour to the reception outing as local crafts and artworks were lavishly and creatively employed to decorate the massive hall, what some said is “truly reflective of the emerging Nigerian cultural market with potentials to create jobs.” This must have given the use of balloons and other foreign decorations materials a backseat in event planning. Nigerian rich kitchens were not left out as guests were served with mouthwatering indigenous cuisine. As one tourism operator put it, the cultural pre and post-transition outings for Runsewe’s mother, 94, had opened up the many value chain in the Nigerian creative cultural tourism industry, hardly factored and appreciated before now. “Mama Kaduna is no more with us, the culturalisation of her passage by her only son, Otunba Segun Runsewe had enriched the community of local crafts entrepreneurs, empowering their very visibility and their job creation potentiality, a post-Covid-19 gains which must push the button of cultural tourism beyond the national frontier.” And in line with the Covid-19 protocols, all the gates and entrances, at the chapel of Light Church, Idi Araba, Surulere, venue of the commendation service as well as the reception at the venue was manned by a medical emergency team with face masks and hand sanitiser for all invitees.
