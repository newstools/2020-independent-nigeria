ABUJA – As second wave of COVID -19 pandemic ravages across the country, 86 patients are said to be receiving treatment during this yuletide at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital (UATH), Gwagwalada and ThisDay Dome. Out of 86 COVID-19 patients in the nation’s capital, UATH have about 42, ThisDay Dome 44, and Idu isolation and treat­ment center none. However, 22 out of the 42 pa­tients are said to be very severe and critical and only surviving through oxygenation. This shows that the second wave is even more virulent than the first wave.

Confirming the critical condition of the patients, the FCT Permanent Secretary, Mr. Adesola Olusade who toured the centres over the weekend, noted that apart from the 22 pa­tients on oxygen, the reports about the places were impres­sive. Olusade said that while non-critical cases are being managed at home, 86 patients were receiving treatment at both the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital (UATH) and the ThisDay Dome centres re­spectively, with zero case at the Idu centre.
