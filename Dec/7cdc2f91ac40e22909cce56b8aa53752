…Urges Nigerians To Expect Little From Club In Return Leg Lagos- Ahead of the return leg of the CAF Champions League game between Enyimba International and Al-Merreikh of Sudan in Aba January, former coach of the club, Kadiri Ikhana, has taking a look into why the eight times Nigerian champions crashed in Omdurman last week. Recall that the Sudanese giants whipped the former African Champions 3-0, leaving the Peoples Elephants with a mountain to climb in order to make it into the money-spinning group stage of the elite continental club competition.

The CAF Champions League winning coach, while speaking to our correspondent, said the Aba Elephants could not have produced any magic in Sudan given that they lacked the requisite preparations to tackle one of the two biggest teams in Sudan. Ikhana, who explained that it was not entirely the fault of the team in their lethargic performance against Al-Merreikh, noted that even before the match, Enyimba had issues with a couple of their players, saying even as the second leg beckons, Nigerians should not expect much from the serial Nigerian Champions.

And we have some players in Enyimba that did not coordinate well before the match came up.” “There was nothing they could have done; they should just try and see if they can make it but to return those three goals is a very difficult situation.” “In terms of motivation and all that, all the teams (from Nigeria) in the Champions League and Confederation Cup did not prepare well”, he said. Enyimba will host Al-Merreikh in Aba in the first week of January 2021 with the aggregate winner making it into the group stage of the Champions League while the loser drops down to the CAF Confederation Cup.
