BENIN – Dr. Felix Omobude, President, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, (PFN) on Wednesday declared that the PFN was solidly behind the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Rev. (Dr.) Matthew Kukah, over his comments on the state of the nation and called on those attacking him to desist from it and should not use him as the sacrificial lamb. He made the call while speaking on issues as they relate to the current states of the nation. Dr. Omobude said the Bishop spoke truth to power and that it was the minds of most Nigerians and should be commended for voicing out when others seemed to have kept quiet when actually things are getting out of control.
