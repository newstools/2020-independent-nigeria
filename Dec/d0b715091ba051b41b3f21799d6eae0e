The Arewa Council of Chiefs Lagos State has described those behind publications in the social media and one of the national dailies intend­ed to tarnish the name of the late Sarkin Hausawa Lagos, Ali Mohammed Kabir, as ungodly and without respect for culture. In a statement signed by the Secretary, Arewa Council of Chiefs, Lagos, Alhaji Ahmed Danbatta, expressed disappointment in the manner the group painted the late chief in bad light in the publications. He further stressed that casting aspersion on late chief is not part of Arewa and Nigerian culture.

Dambatta in the statement implored the group to join other Lagosians and Arewa community in particular in observing the mourning pe­riod instead of pouring out venom on the late chief. He said, “Our response is solely to appeal to those behind this write-up of the need to maintain calm es­pecially during this period of mourning.

He urged the public espe­cially Arewa community in Lagos to be wary of the mali­cious intention of the group. The write-up which was signed by one Suleiman Bala Abdullahi, according to Danbatta, who is neither a member of Lagos State Council of Arewa Chiefs nor a Chief, was a ploy by Shakabula Peoples Demo­cratic Party (PDP), through Sarkin Fulani, in Lagos, Muhammadu Bamabado, to humiliate the late Sarkin Hausawa, even at death. We gathered that he is a serving civil servant in the Lagos State Government. He is also said to be a ploy planted by Shakabu­la PDP leaders through Sarkin Fulani Muhamma­du Bambado, a dockyard worker in former PDP Na­tional Chairman, Bamanga Tukur’s shipping service. “We advise Alhaji Mu­hammad Bambado to es­chew hatred against the de­ceased and go and convey his condolences to the fam­ily of the deceased Sarkin Hausawa of Lagos, Alhaji Sani Muhammad Kabir, in accordance with Islamic injunctions and traditions. “He should fear Allah and stop sponsoring campaign of calumny and lies against the dead. Everyone is on the same journey to where our late Sarki has gone. Those who have gone are not too fast neither are the remain­ing ever late,” he stated. SHOCKING!
