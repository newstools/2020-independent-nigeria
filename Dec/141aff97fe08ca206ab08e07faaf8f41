Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi is pessimistic about his side’s chances of luring Neymar back to the Camp Nou from Paris Saint-Germain. The Brazilian forward swapped Barcelona for Paris in 2017, becoming the most expensive player of all-time after the Ligue 1 giants activated a £199.5million release clause in his contract. Neymar has been heavily linked with a return to the club ever since, though Messi’s recent struggles with Barcelona has also seen speculation that he could move in the same direction. Messi is free to sign a pre-contract agreement with non-Spanish clubs from January 1st but the Argentine appears to have settled his dispute at the Camp Nou and could extend his deal. The return of Neymar to the club would certainly help convince Messi to stay but the Argentina captain says the financial situation at the Camp Nou will make any transfer impossible. ‘How do you pay Paris for the transfer?’ Messi asked.  ‘It is not easy, it will be a difficult situation for the new president. He will have to be very intelligent, get everything in order and make many changes to make it go well. ‘It will also be difficult to bring in players because we need money and there is no money. There are several important current players we need to fight again for everything and you have to pay them.’ Neymar said last month that he wished to play with Messi again, though he didn’t clarify whether that was in Paris or Barcelona. Messi was coy about Neymar’s comments, insisting that it was only a declaration of his desire rather than a plan. ‘He didn’t say, ‘Let’s play,’ he said, ‘I’d like to play’ … right?’ said Messi. ‘Yes, we talk from time to time. The three of us either with him or with Luis [Suarez] every day. We maintain the relationship.’ SHOCKING!
