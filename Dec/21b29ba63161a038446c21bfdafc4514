The State Coordinator of Spe­cial Marshal, Elder Emmanuel Fagbenro, assured the new mar­shals of maximum support of the commission, advising them not to violate traffic rules. “Don’t say because you are a special marshal, you will violate traffic rules. Comport yourself whenever you are behind the wheels. Don’t see yourself as masters on the road. Don’t use the ample chance to retaliate whoever has offended you before. We are people of proven integrity. Your assignment is to sanitise the road. On no account must you be caught extorting money. You are all teachers, so you have no hid­den places. This inauguration is very timely because we are in the yuletide period,” he said.

We are selfless and ready to give back to society. That is why we have organised ourselves together as a group to achieve this goal. “ Today, we are donating a split AC and three dozens of plastic chairs to the commis­sion. We have also paid for a ra­dio programme at Paramount FM against Monday to reach out to as many as possible, advising them to be careful on the road during this yuletide. We have made up our mind to spend our money and time to support FRSC initia­tives,” Oluwatoyin said. The members, both male and female were decorated by the representative of the sector com­mander during the ceremony in the presence of their spouses. Other dignitaries at the event were the Divisional Police Offi­cers of both Mowe and Redemp­tion Camp Stations and senior officers of the Ogun State Traf­fic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE).
