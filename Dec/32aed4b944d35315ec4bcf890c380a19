Aguero, who recently returned to the first team, has asked for “a little bit of time” as he looks to get back to his best after undergoing knee surgery. The Brazilian has featured 11 times in all competitions, scoring four total goals with two of those finishes coming in the Premier League. Walker, meanwhile, has appeared 18 times in all competitions for Manchester City, having featured in 12 of the club’s 13 total league matches this campaign. Manchester City currently sit eighth in the table, but have a game in hand on each of the top seven aside from third-place Manchester United. Guardiola’s side are currently eight points back of league-leaders Liverpool, who host West Brom on Sunday, as well as three points behind fourth-place Everton, who are level with Man Utd on 26 points having played an extra game.
