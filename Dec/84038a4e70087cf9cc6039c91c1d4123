ABUJA – Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, the Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), has expressed deep concerns over the increasing cases of speed-related crashes record­ed within Yuletide season. Oyeyemi said the increased crashes were observed follow­ing a careful review of the first phase of the End-of-Year Special Patrol embarked upon by personnel of FRSC. In a statement issued in Abuja on Sunday, Bisi Ka­zeem, the Corps Public Educa­tion Officer, Assistant Corps Marshal, noted that the FRSC boss directed commanding of­ficers to step up enforcement of the law on use of speed lim­iting device.

According to him, the Corps marshal expressed satisfaction with the conduct of most drivers and the per­formance of the personnel in containing the rate and fa­talities of road traffic crash­es within the period of the Christmas celebration. But Oyeyemi expressed concerns that the increasing level of speed-induced crash­es as recorded within the peri­od is undermining the efforts of the Corps to ensure safer road environments, saying every step must be taken to restore normalcy to the roads.

While warning the drivers to be cautious of the speed, which has become a major causative factor in crash oc­currences within the period under review, despite the massive public enlighten­ment campaigns launched by the Corps to sensitise members of the public on the menace of speed induced crashes, the Corps Marshal described the phenomenon as unacceptable. “We must step up enforce­ment of the regulations on use of speed limiting device in the second phase of the special op­erations and first quarter of next year to drastically force down the growing trends of speed induced crashes,” he stated. “Commanding officers are hereby given special direc­tives on aggressive enforce­ment of the regulations on the use of speed limiting device to curb the rate of crashes and fatalities that speeding caus­es, as shown by the records of the first phase of the special operations.
