Kyari said: “The project is currently at about 15 per cent completion but what is important for us to know is that we are crossing the river Niger, what we call the Ndoni-Aboh river crossing in Rivers and Delta states that will deliver gas from the eastern part to the country into the western corridor. That means expanding gas supply into the helpline and also making gas ready. “We are happy that this project is going on and we will deliver it on course and schedule. We have all the assurances of government and particularly that this government is focused on delivering this project, so that we clear the transnational gas pipeline which has eluded us.
