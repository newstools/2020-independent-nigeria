Ibadan- The allegation that there was an agreement between Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party to allow Eddy Olafeso to return as the Zonal Chairman of the party if he failed to win the governorship race in Ondo State has been described as baseless and unfounded. Olafeso, who was the PDP Vice Chairman had resigned in the wake of the Ondo State governorship election to pursue his governorship ambition. The PDP Chairman in Lagos State, Adedeji Doherty, had in a statement argued that in keeping with the agreement reached with party leaders in the South-West, Olafeso should be returned to the his former position.

Reacting to the statement, The Chairman, Oyo Pacesetters Transport Services, Dare Adeleke said there was no such agreement, alleging that the confusion in the party could be traced to the former Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose. A statement, signed by Adeleke, made available to journalists in Ibadan the Capital City of Oyo State, read that “It is Fayose who thwarted the traditional zoning arrangements of the party. Eddy Olafeso, who was the former chairman in the zone, hails from Ondo State while the National Treasurer, Aribisala Adewale, was imposed on the party when Fayose was the governor of Ekiti State.

Normally, the position of Treasurer is supposed to come to Oyo State. Fayose is like a man determined to set his own house on fire.” “Fayose is a perpetual traitor. He is a constant visitor at Tinubu’s house. Of recent, the senators visited their colleagues. Our most distinguished Senator Kola Balogun was at the entourage of visiting senators to commiserate with the Lagos State Government.” “At this meeting, we got information that Tinubu reiterated his support for Fayose. He advised Senator Abiodun Olujinmi to reconcile with Fayose but our Iron Lady told him that he should advise Fayose to join him in the All Progressives Congress.” Fayose and his cohorts are working for Tinubu and are hell bent on polarizing the party so he can lay claim to the zonal leadership, all for the purpose of helping Tinubu achieve his dream of becoming President of Nigeria in 2023. “I advise the national leadership of our great party to be mindful of Fayose who is an APC ally. They would do well to listen to advise from Governor Seyi Makinde. Governor Makinde was recently named the best performing governor. He is a man of proven integrity and he is fit to lead the party to success.” SHOCKING!
