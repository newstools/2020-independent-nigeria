Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Uma­ra Zulum, on Tuesday visited the headquarters of 151 Battalion at Banki junction in Bama, and an­nounced a Christmas pack­age for each of the over 700 soldiers and their officers, who are fighting Boko Ha­ram. Zulum, on arrival, entered into a closed door meeting with Commander of the 21 Special Armored Brigade, Brigadier General Waheed Shaibu, and Commanding Officer of the 151 Battalion, Major A. A. Umar, after which the Governor addressed troops. “On the basis of fairness, I treat everyone or group on their own merit.
