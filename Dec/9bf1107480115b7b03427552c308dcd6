Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta says he is confident that Bukayo Saka will be fit to face West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. The Gunners winger was forced off in the latter stages of Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Brighton at the AMEX Stadium on Tuesday, sparking fears that he could be set for a spell on the sidelines. Any potential absence would be a huge blow for Arteta, with Saka firmly establishing himself as one of Arsenal’s key attacking players in recent weeks.

The England international impressed yet again at Brighton, supplying the assist for Alexandre Lacazette’s late winner. But Arteta is hopeful that the 19-year-old will be available for selection as the Gunners travel to the Hawthorns for their first match of 2021.

Luiz was forced into a period of self-isolation after being told that he had also been in contact with someone that had tested positive for Covid-19, whilst Willian was “unwell”. And Arteta believes the pair could play some part against Sam Allardyce’s West Brom. “Well, we will see today. Some players had to come in yesterday to get assessed. After the game we had a couple of knocks. “And then we have the players who have been through all the regulations with COVID, different individuals which I think we’re gonna recover for the game against West Brom. “But we will see tomorrow who is available, who is fit, and how is everybody feeling. The Gunners will be desperate to make it three league wins in a row, but come up against a West Brom side who will be itching to bounce back from their 5-0 defeat to Leeds United on Tuesday. Ahead of facing Allardyce for the first time as a manager, Arteta said: “Sam is very efficient at what he does. He has a very clear philosophy of playing, he always picked up results, he always made it really difficult for you and it’s not gonna be different. “His teams are always organised and they know exactly what to do so, it will be a tough test again.” SHOCKING!
