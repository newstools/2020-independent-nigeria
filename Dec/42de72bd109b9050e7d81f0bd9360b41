UGHELLI – Dr, Hyacinth Egbebo, Catho­lic Bishop of Bomadi Diocese, has accused the Federal Gov­ernment for being only inter­ested in the militarisation of the Niger Delta region rather than development. He said it was quiet appalling that the oil revenue is shared as a national cake whereas the money realised from Zamfara gold gets to individuals’ pockets. Egbebo, who spoke to jour­nalists shortly after the ordi­nation of five priests and three deacons at St. Patrick’s parish, Ovom, Yenagoa, in Bayelsa State, stated that the Bomadi Catholic Dioceses, which cut across three local government areas of Delta State, the whole of Bayelsa State and parts of Rivers State, was in dire need of priests to reach 3.5 million people for evangelism.
