Inter Milan chief executive Giuseppe Marotta has confirmed that attacking midfielder Christian Eriksen has been placed on the transfer list and will leave the club in the upcoming January transfer window. The Denmark international, who turns 29-years-old in less than two months time, joined Inter back in January after wanting to test himself elsewhere following a seven-year spell with Tottenham Hotspur. Though Eriksen arrived in Italy expecting to prove himself as a big-name star in Serie A, his time with Inter has struggled to get off the ground, with him having been restricted to just 38 appearances in all competitions.

This season, the former Spurs ace has struggled to nail down a place in Antonio Conte’s plans, being restricted to a paltry 12 appearances in all competitions, failing to score or grab a single assist. With his Inter career seemingly over less than 12 months after his arrival at the San Siro, he is going to be allowed to leave the Italian heavyweights next month.

He’s going to leave in January. “He’s not functional to our plans and he had difficulty here at Inter. I think it’s right that Christian goes away to find more space.” The truth behind William Saliba’s exile from Arsenal after Mikel Arteta decisionInter’s decision to put Eriksen on the transfer list ahead of the window opening will have no doubt put a plethora of European clubs on red alert, with the Danish midfielder, when on song, considered as one of the most inventive attacking-midfielders that football can shout about. Throughout his Tottenham career, Eriksen was considered as one of the Premier League’s best architects, with his talents in the final third rarely going unnoticed. Among the clubs that could be keen on an expressing an interest in Eriksen’s services are Arsenal, who were closely linked with signing the Denmark international only a few weeks ago. Should Arsenal launch a January move for Eriksen, it would probably not come as too great a surprise to the Gunners’ supporters, with the club having been desperate to land a central attacking-midfielder during the summer. Throughout the extended summer window Arsenal were heavily linked with Lyon star Houssem Aouar. The Gunners did lodge a bid for the Frenchman but were unsuccessful in their efforts. Though Aouar has continued to be linked with a move to the Emirates Stadium in recent weeks, Eriksen is likely to be a far cheaper option, especially when taking into consideration the former Spurs man’s age.
