LAGOS – SSC Napoli of Italy striker, Victor Osimhen, has received a new verdict of optimism about his expected date of full recovery from a shoulder injury he copped in action for the Super Eagles and a new target of January 2021 for his return to action. Napoli’s Sporting director, Cristiano Giuntoli, has now enthused that Osimhen will be back playing for the club next month, as he cited the start of 2021 as the new possi­ble return date for the striker, going by the latest update. This, though, is in contrast with initial reports that the Naples-based side were ex­pecting Osimhen back in action before 2020 runs out, as Giuntoli affirmed that the 21-year old Super Ea­gles’ youngster is no longer expected to play until Janu­ary 2021.

I don’t know when he will come back, we will see in what conditions it will be, and we will evaluate.” It will be recalled that the former Lille Metropole of France striker has missed nine matches for Napoli and one for Nigeria since bowing out with a shoulder dislocation in the Super Ea­gles’ Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone, which ended 4-4 in Benin City.
