US President Donald Trump on Sunday signed the Taiwan Assurance Act into law, which was part of the wider US$1.4 trillion federal government spending bill for the fiscal year of 2021, Anadolu Agency reported. After days of stalling, the bill was jointly signed with COVID-19 stimulus package that includes US$900 billion aid. The US House of Representatives had unanimously passed the Taiwan Assurance Act in May 2019 when it was added to that fiscal year’s spending bill for the Senate to consider.
