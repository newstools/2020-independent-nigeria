UMUAHIA – Igbo at home and in the Diaspora on Sunday called on the National Assembly to amend the Electoral Act with the view to compelling political parties to insert in their respective party Con­stitutions the rotation of Nigeria’s Presidency. According to them, the provision of the clause should be one of the re­quirements of registering new political parties and accepting old ones as legit­imate parties by the Inde­pendent National Electoral Commission (INEC). In a communiqué after a two-day Special World Igbo Congress (WIC) held at the Gregory University, Uturu (GUU), Igbos asked their kinsmen and wom­en to liaise with their col­leagues from other zones at the National Assembly to make it as a law for INEC to withdraw its recognition of any party that does not insert the clause of rota­tional Presidency in their Constitutions.
