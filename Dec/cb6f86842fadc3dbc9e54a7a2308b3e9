The earthquake was felt throughout the country on Tuesday, as well as in neighbouring Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and as far away as Graz in southern Austria. Buildings collapsed in Petrinja, some 60km (37 miles) from Zagreb.

He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky, old buildings and move to the newer areas of the city because of the aftershocks. (SOURCE: Aljazeera) SHOCKING!
