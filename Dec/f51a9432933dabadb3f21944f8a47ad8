Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has penned a heartfelt message to the club’s fans thanking them for their role in a successful year for the Reds. Jurgen Klopp’s side were finally able to end Liverpool’s 30-year wait for another domestic title in 2020 and land their first of the Premier League era. Sadly for the Reds’ loyal supporters, none of them were allowed to be present for the title run-in, with Liverpool eventually lifting the trophy in an empty Anfield.

The Reds had virtually had the championship sewn up by the time the coronavirus outbreak forced all games behind closed doors, though, holding a 22-point gap over nearest rivals Man City when the season was suspended. And Henderson was keen to stress the important role Liverpool’s fans had in helping them to their triumph. Klopp Talks Respect For Allardyce CAN Commends Zamfara Govt. Over Security During Xmas “With this being our last home game of the year, I want to finish off by looking back on a remarkable 12 months and offer my own very simple Christmas message to our supporters,” Henderson wrote in his programme notes ahead of the West Brom clash. “To each and every one of you, I want to say thank you. We have been fortunate enough to be successful and even though you were not always able to be in the ground, your contribution has been immense. “We didn’t just win the league title for our fans, we won it because of them and I hope those of you who celebrate Christmas, and also those of you who don’t, are able to find an opportunity to toast the role that you played in our success. “I know I’ll be doing that, with a soft drink rather than anything stronger, and when I do I will raise a glass to Liverpool supporters for inspiring us every step of the way.” Liverpool have kept up their title-winning form to top the table for the third time running at Christmas, all while weathering an ongoing injury crisis. They now have the opportunity to extend their lead even further over some of the chasing pack, after Leicester and Man Utd each dropped two points in their draw at the King Power stadium on Boxing Day. West Brom arrive at Anfield 19th in the table, and with a new manager in the hotseat, but Henderson is taking nothing for granted. “Today’s game against West Brom is another tough one, especially with Sam Allardyce having taken over so recently, but hopefully we can end the Anfield year in a positive fashion,” he added. “We have done a lot of things right over the last 12 months, but we have to keep that going if we want the awards and accolades to continue.” SHOCKING!
