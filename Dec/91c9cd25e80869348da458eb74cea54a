Ongoing conflicts have deprived at least 3.4 million children of polio vaccination across Afghanistan this year, an official said on Wednesday. The Afghan Ministry of Health inaugurated a five-day nationwide campaign between Nov. 30 and Dec. 4 to vaccinate at least 9.9 million children, a public relations officer for the anti-polio campaign, Mir Jan Rasikh told dpa. The health officers, however, could only reach 6.5 million children in the country’s 34 provinces, Rasikh said.

Provinces such as Helmand in the south, Ghazni in south-east and Baghlan, Kunduz and Takhar in the north have the highest number of children left without the polio vaccination. This was due to opposition from armed groups such as the Taliban, who did not allow access to health workers for the door-to-door campaigns in areas under their control, Raskhi added.

They have now built up a system to vaccinate children in a mosque or in the house of an elder of a village in areas under their control, Mujahid said. Apart from the war, some social barriers have also blocked the ministry from delivering the vital health service, Rasikh said. Cases of polio rose in Afghanistan this year, with at least 56 positive cases recorded across the country, the ministry said. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the two countries where the fatal virus has yet to be eliminated. (dpa/NAN) SHOCKING!
