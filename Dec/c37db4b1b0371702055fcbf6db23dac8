Former Manchester United hardman Roy Keane would have made a “great boxer”, according to world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. Keane developed a reputation as one of the toughest and most fearsome midfielders in Premier League history at United, a persona he seems to have maintained since transitioning into punditry. The Irishman’s no-nonsense approach on TV is pretty reflective of the cold-blooded, ruthless way he went about his business on the pitch.

The United legend often trained with fighters much older than him, but in the end he eventually opted to pursue football – which didn’t turn out to be a bad decision. Nevertheless, he still partook in boxing training during his time at Old Trafford and could still very much pack a punch. “I had an interview with him before I trained him to make sure I knew what he’d been doing and what he was hoping to do and what he thought of different types of training,” strength and conditioning coach Mick Clegg told Stretty News. “He told me that he used to box and, of course, I had a boxing club at my gym that I’d had for 14 years so I thought it was fantastic. “I asked him he’d be interested in learning some boxing techniques that I’d actually developed for football players and he said he was. “So we went down into the gym – when it was appropriate during his rehab – and we did some boxing training. And of course whenever Roy was in the gym, everyone wanted to be there. “Players were coming in to watch Roy and he looked magnificent when he was boxing.” SHOCKING!
