As Igbo leaders strategise on the election of new leaders for the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, Chief Emeka Charles Kalu, has called on them to elect someone who can be a veritable mouthpiece for Ndigbo and not a political stooge to authorities. Kalu, a former governorship candidate of Abia State and National Coordinator, Peoples Democratic Party Coalition (PDPCO), who spoke exclusively with SUNDAY INDEPENDENT on Saturday, maintained that Ohanaeze Ndigbo was supposed to be the voice of the Igbo ethnic nationality, just like every other national bodies of other socio-cultural in Nigeria, like the Afenifere and the Arewa Consultative Form (ACF), for the Yoruba and the Hausa Fulani, respectively. He, however, lamented that over the years, Ohanaeze Ndigbo leaders had been playing the role of political tools, rather than that of socio-cultural body when such circumstances arose, thereby making it to lose its voice and relevance to the extent that it had become an object of ridicule among Ndigbo and people of other nationalities.

But, ours seems to be playing the role of defending the interests of few, while the rest of us are languishing. “This should be an opportunity to end such trend and choose a leader that will help Ohanaeze Ndigbo live up to its usefulness in the business of protecting the interest of Ndigbo at all times.” SHOCKING!
