As Nigeria grapples with increasing food insecurity and the highest malnutrition burden in Africa, the Micronutrient Fortification Index (MFI), a self- regulatory system designed to incentivise food processors, would address low fortification compliance rates for staple foods with essential vitamins and minerals in Nigeria. The new innovation designed by the international nonprofit organisation TechnoServe through the Strengthening African Processors of Fortified Foods (SAPFF) programme, is helping to improve the population’s nutrition through increased food fortification. The MFI is an industry-led and -owned self-assessment tool that allows companies to evaluate existing procedures and practices against national and global fortification standards.

The development of this new tool is playing a role in recent improvements TechnoServe recently reported in Nigerian food fortification rates. In the three years since the SAPFF programme began, the country’s supply of fortified wheat flour and sugar has increased by 68% and 200%, respectively, enabling over 90% of Nigeria’s population to access this more nutritious food.

Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo at the recently concluded Third Annual Food Processing and Nutritional Leadership Forum, convened virtually by Alhaji Aliko Dangote and Mr. Bill Gates, keynote speaker, said: “The Micronutrient Fortification Index (MFI) is an interesting innovation that will motivate industries to self-regulate in meeting government standards for food fortification. “The use of this tool should be adopted by all companies involved in fortification and I believe it should be made available to stakeholders and shareholders alike. We should be able to hold them accountable as they strive to meet industry benchmarks, including compliance with Nigerian Fortification Standards. Government regulatory agencies will definitely find the tool useful in support of industry regulation efforts and consumer expectations.” So far, twelve processors, including Flour Mills of Nigeria plc, PZ Wilmar Limited, Olam (which now encompasses Dangote Flour Mills) and Honeywell Flour Mills Plc, have signed up to the index, with keen interest from other participants to join the process in 2021 when the index will scale up to capture all players operating in the wheat flour, sugar, salt, and edible oil sectors.
