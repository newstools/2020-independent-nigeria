Part of the statement read: “We understand the unfortunate state COVID-19 infection has put every­body the world over, which caused some state govern­ments to place total ban on the crossover night ser­vice and we are not happy that we would not be able to enter into the new year prayerfully in joint fellow­ship with our brothers and sisters. “We, however, urge you all to abide by the directives of each state government on this so as to prevent the spread of the infection.

It is a passing phase and this too shall pass away in Jesus name. “Very soon, the pandem­ic will become history and we will return to our usual routine services in Jesus’ name. “We appeal to all state governments to be relating with the leadership of CAN under their watches for un­derstanding and support on their directives. “We are partners in the progress and development of the country. “We also call on local government authorities to enforce the COVID-19 proto­cols in our markets and in the transport sector.” The CAN leader also paid condolences to the family of the late Professor Charles Adeyinka Adisa. Rev. (Dr.) Ayokunle said: “On behalf of the leader­ship of the Christian Asso­ciation of Nigeria (CAN), I commiserate with the fam­ily of the late Prof Charles Yinka Adisa on his glorious home call. “It was one death too many because nobody ex­pected such God’s General to depart from the scene when his contributions were still highly needed. “Prof Adisa used his influence and position to speak for the Church in the country. “He led the Nigeria Christian Graduate Fel­lowship and other relat­ed groups to champion the cause of the Body of Christ. “We cannot forget their contributions during the agitation for the resto­ration of Christian Re­ligious Knowledge back to public schools, CAN’s position on the contro­versial Ruga Settlements, Company Allied Matters Act (CAMA), lopsided ap­pointments, etc. “Our consolation is that, for Christians, to die is gain. He served the King­dom to the end and he has gone to his rewards. “Our condolences go to his immediate family, espe­cially his wife, who stood by him to the end, the Nigeria Christian Graduate Fellow­ship, the Think Tank for the Body of Christ, colleagues, friends and relatives. “May his home call be a challenge to us to be sin­cere in our services of the Lord.” SHOCKING!
