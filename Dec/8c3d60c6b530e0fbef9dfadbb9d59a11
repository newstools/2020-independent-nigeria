An estimated 10.4 million children in seven coun­tries, including Nigeria, will suffer from acute malnutrition in 2021, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said in a state­ment on Wednesday. “As 2021 approaches, UNICEF is deeply con­cerned for the health and well-being of 10.4 million children projected to suf­fer from acute malnutri­tion next year in those countries,” the statement said, citing the affected countries as Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Sudan, South Sudan and Yemen. UNICEF said ongoing insecurity in the DRC, so­cio-economic consequences of the coronavirus pandem­ic and limited access to es­sential services will result in an estimated 3.3 million children, under five, who will suffer from acute mal­nutrition next year.
