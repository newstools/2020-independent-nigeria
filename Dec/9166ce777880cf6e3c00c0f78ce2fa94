OWERRI – As the nation continues to lick her wounds arising from the EndSARS protests, the traditional ruler of Ishi Ubomiri Community, in the Mbaitoli council area of Imo state, HRH Eze Emma Saint George Ekeh, has advised the Federal Government to adopt proactive measures to avert a repeat of the incident in the New Year. “We need to set up indus­tries and factories all over the place so that the youths will stop trooping to Lagos and Abuja in search of jobs”, even as he advised the Federal Gov­ernment to channel the huge funds currently lying idle with the NEXIM, BOA, BOI, and the CBN into agricultur­al ventures, training and skill acquisition. Additionally, as a signato­ry to the Africa Free Trade Agreement, the monarch also advised the Federal Govern­ment to take advantage of this and ensure full utilization of the opportunity embedded in the agreement, stressing that this would not only strength­en the economic integration of African nations, but would equally be of tremendous benefits to the nation’s teem­ing unemployed youths.
