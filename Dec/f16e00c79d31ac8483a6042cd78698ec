ABUJA- The Nigerian Union of Mines Workers (NUMW) has said that the completion and operationalization of Ajaokuta Steel Company (ASCO) and National Iron Ore Mining Company (NIOMCO) cannot be overemphasized in view of the ability of the complex to create at least fifteen thousand jobs for Nigerians. Saying, we are aware of the avowed commitment of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to the completion of the project, we are of the opinion that government should accelerate its pace, as the pace of progress is slow, and does not represent Nigeria’s passion for progress in the area of jobs creation. Speaking on behalf of the group, the President, NUMW Comr Hamza Muhammad said, “We specifically task the Federal Government and the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development as well as the steering committee for the implementation of completion and operationalisation of ASCO to work to realize set goals in the coming year 2021.

The group, however called on the government to convene a stakeholders consultative conference on the Nigerian Mines and Steel Sector. The conference, if convened, will serve as platform for the discussion of the challenges of the sector by relevant stakeholders who know the sector well enough, to give correct advice to the government.

As part from stakeholders that participated in the 2020 Technology Conference convened by the National Action Committee on the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, the NUMW can correctly say that the Nigerian Mining Sector needs to key into global best practices in mining technology. The group commended the effort of government to digitalize the Mining Cadastre Office, saying, we also desire a sector which private sector will be able to embrace world class advancements in mining technology. There is need to harness digital technologies for economic development and expansion in the mining sector, especially in the private sector as is being advocated by African Union under the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). We called on the administration to check its strategies and put in place, effective working relationships that will pave way for the formation and implementation of the right policies that will lead to the speedy realization of set goal.
