A new strain of COVID-19 is 56% more transmissible that earlier variants and may result in a significant increase in infections, according to scientists from the London-based Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID). In a study published on the CMMID’s website, researchers said they had created “a two-strain mathematical model of coronavirus transmission to observed COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital and ICU [Intensive Care Unit] bed occupancy, and deaths”. They added they were unable to find “clear evidence” that the new strain results in “greater or lesser severity” of the disease than regular COVID-19.
