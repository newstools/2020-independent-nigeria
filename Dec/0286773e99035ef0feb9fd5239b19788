The Gunners have started appallingly, and are still lingering towards the foot of the table. Despite their impressive win over Frank Lampard’s side, they’re still 15th in the table, with Arteta facing a mammoth task ahead of him.

However, the club’s owner Stan Kroenke has apparently told Arteta that if he wants to sign any players this January, he’ll have to sell first. Arsenal are eager to sign a new creative midfielder considering their poor attacking movement this season. They are unlikely to recall Mesut Ozil to the squad, reports state, despite the side crying out for a player like him. Arteta has already missed out on one of his top transfer targets, Dominik Szoboszlai, who joined RB Leipzig from RB Salzburg. But according to The Athletic, there are concerns that the Arsenal squad is too big at the moment, and will require trimming in January. William Saliba will likely depart – albeit on loan – after failing to find his feet in England since joining from St Etienne in 2019. And it is possible they will look to move on a few players who are out of contract at the end of the season. Ozil is set to leave for nothing at the end of the season, but could be shopped around in January for a minimal fee to avoid Arsenal missing out on a transfer fee. They also have Sokratis, David Luiz and Shkodran Mustafi out of contract, and it remains plausible that any of those three could leave. Arsenal are also bracing themselves for a flurry of bids from Barcelona for Hector Bellerin, with reports suggesting presidential candidate Joan Laporta is eager to sign him. If he is to go, the Gunners are apparently lining up a move for Brighton defender Tariq Lamptey. That one might wait until the summer, however, with the presidential elections not taking place until January. (SOURCE: Express UK) SHOCKING!
