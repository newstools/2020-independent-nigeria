Mauricio Pochettino is expected to become the new Paris Saint-Germain manager. That’s according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, who reported on Thursday that the former Tottenham Hotspur boss has reached an agreement with the Ligue 1 outfit about replacing Thomas Tuchel. The German departed PSG on Christmas Eve despite guiding them into the Champions League knockout stage and sitting a point behind Lyon in the Ligue 1 table.

Pochettino was quickly installed as one of the favourites to replace Tuchel at the Parc des Princes, and now it would appear that an official announcement is all that remains.Out of work since leaving Spurs over a year ago, the Argentine looks set to realise a lifelong dream by managing PSG – whom he used to play for. “I have always said that one day it would be a pleasure to manage a big club like Paris, a dream,” Pochettino previously told RMC in 2016.

With that said, there could be another scenario in which this particular managerial appointment might affect the north London outfit.The report stats that Spurs have continued to pay Pochettino’s £8.5million-per-year salary due to a payroll clause inserted in the lucrative contract he signed in 2018 – which intended to keep him at the club until 2023. In addition, Tottenham will also remove the 48-year-old’s coaching staff – Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Toni Jimenez – from their wage bill and that extra cash could help fund moves in the January window.
