Arsenal defender Gabriel has tested positive for coronavirus and is now isolating after previously missing out on a clash with Chelsea over the weekend. The club confirmed that Gabriel had been in close contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19 and will isolate as a precaution. His quarantine kept him out of the Gunners’ 3-1 win over Chelsea, as he began a period of isolation that will keep him out of games with Brighton on December 29 and West Brom on January 2.

The club has previously confirmed that David Luiz and Willian recently tested negative for coronavirus and their situations will be closely monitored. The Brazilian trio are joined on the absentee list by Thomas Partey, who remains out with a left thigh issue. “Thomas has progressed well since the injury on 6 December,” a club statement read. “He has started to train outside and will continue with his daily assessments and monitoring.” Gabriel joined Arsenal in September and has emerged as a regular under manager Mikel Arteta. The defender has featured in 15 total matches across Premier League and Europa League action, scoring two goals in domestic play. David Luiz has featured 14 times this season for the Gunners, while Willian, a summer signing from Chelsea, has yet to score in 16 total appearances for Arsenal this term. The Gunners currently sit 15th in the Premier League table, just six points ahead of the bottom three. Arsenal are also facing a 10-point gap between themselves and the top four.
