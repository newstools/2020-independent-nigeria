MINNA – There was a mild drama yesterday at the Niger State House of Assembly complex as the Majority Leader of the House, Abba Bala Moham­med, and his deputy, Binta Mamman, were impeached. The duo who assumed office in July this year after the former occupants of the seats were removed, were impeached during the leg­islature’s last sitting before embarking on the Christmas and new year vacation over alleged negligence of duty. However, the legislators de­cided to reverse the impeach­ment of the House Deputy Leader, Binta Mamman, be­cause she was absent, on iso­lation having tested positive to Coronaviirus, while that of the Majority Leader ,who is representing Borgu Constit­uency stood.
