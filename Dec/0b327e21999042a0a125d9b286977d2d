Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, has revealed that he was marked down for elimination for saying the truth and defending it at all times. The governor, who spoke during his visit to Makurdi Prison on Boxing Day, in a statement made available to SUNDAY INDEPENDENT, however, maintained that God did not allow the plots of the alleged masterminds to execute their plot against him. Ortom was reacting to the recent happenings in the nation and the calls for herders to embrace ranching to end the spate of killings across the country.

Otherwise, I am aware that my death was planned and programmed, but God never allowed them to execute it. “And that is why we are not going anywhere. The good people are suppressed. The evil people, the real criminals are the ones going about and molesting people. “I have always said that this country is infested with a lot of injustice. Sometimes, you see people imprisoned for stealing chickens and goats. Those who stole billions are outside there harassing people and insulting our collective sensibilities. “There has been a failure of leadership across the board, myself included. Over the years, we have not been able to provide the kind of leadership our people desired. “That is why we need a conference and restructuring. But, when you talk about a Sovereign National Conference (SNC), when you talk about restructuring, people, because, they have their hidden agenda, start to kick against it. “If they don’t have any hidden agenda, why can’t we sit and discuss and agree on what we need to do to reposition this country to make it better for all of us than making it better for individuals?” Ortom continued: “We know several people who have stolen billions, in spite of the fight against corruption and nothing is happening to them. We know the pains they are causing people. That is why we do not have good roads. That is why our railway is not working and other infrastructure. “So, we have to sit down and discuss these things, we cannot run away from them.” SHOCKING!
