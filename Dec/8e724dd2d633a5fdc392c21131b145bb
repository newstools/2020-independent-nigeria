ADO-EKITI – The organised labour unions in Ekiti State have threatened to embark on strike should Governor Kayode Fayemi fails to implement the new minimum wage in January 2021. The unions, in a com­munique jointly signed by the Chairmen of Nigerian Labour Congress, Coms Ko­lapo Olatunde, Trade Union Congress, Sola Adigun and Joint Negotiating Committee, Kayode Fatomiluyi claimed to have reached a certain agree­ment with the governor on the matter. Recall that Fayemi after the minimum wage was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018 had implemented the pay­ment for workers on grade levels 01 and 06, promising to effect such across the board when the finances of the state improve.
