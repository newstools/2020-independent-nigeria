LAGOS – Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, Dr. Emeka Charles Kalu, has described the appointment of a Sole Administration for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) as illegal and a way to encourage looting and plundering of the nation’s resources. Speaking through a statement in Lagos, Kalu, the National Coordinator of the Peoples Democratic Party Coalition (PDPCO) and South East Director of Reset Nigeria Group, maintained that such action, which he said would be anti-development, should not be allowed by well-meaning people of the Niger Delta. Kalu lamented that a government that claimed to be fighting corruption would create a position, which he stressed, was not in the Establishing Act of the NNPC, stressing that the move, if allowed, would worsen the corruption index in the agency.

The PDP chieftain urged President Muhammadu Buhari to, as a matter of urgency, swear in a substantive caretaker committee that would man the NNPC, while the Minister of the Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio should continue with the on-going forensic audit of the agency. Kalu said: “We totally reject the attempt by Akpabio and his co-travellers to pocket NDDC by appointing his brother as Sole Administrator, who will completely hand over the NDDC budget to Akpabio and his collaborators to share, while the region remains in abject poverty, thereby betraying the purpose for which NDDC was set up.
