LAGOS  – Prophet Samuel Shittu, General Overseer, Restoration and Prophetic Grace Evangelistic Ministry (RPGEM), Egbeda, Ibadan, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to be sensitive to the plight of Nigerians. Lamenting the hike in prices of foodstuffs, items and cost of living, Shittu said the citizens do not deserve the hardship they are experiencing being that Nigeria is blessed with abundant resources. The cleric made the appeal at the church’s prayer conference held between December 24 and 26, 2020. Maintaining that Nigeria needs God’s intervention even as the year comes to a close, he said prayers will be specially offered to seek God’s face for 2021. SHOCKING!
