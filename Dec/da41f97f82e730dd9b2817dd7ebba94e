Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Resident Electoral Commissioner in Akwa Ibom State, Mike Igini, has been urged to forgive the infamous Director of Communication, Ize-Iyamu Campaign Organisation, Mr John Mayaki, over failed character assassination plot by the Edo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC). President of Agbon Peace and Economic Transformation Initiative (APETRI), Dr Fred Latimore Oghenesivbe, made the appeal in a statement on Saturday 26th December, saying that the public apology by Mayaki goes to show that Igini’s integrity cannot be faulted by an overzealous politician who knew next to nothing in political propaganda and electioneering communication strategies. It will be recalled that Mayaki and Edo APC during the 2020 gubernatorial election alleged that Igini visited Obaseki in Benin and went home with sacks of money, so as to declare him the winner of the election.

Like Donald Trump, like John Mayaki, it turned out to be fake news, a character assassination plot hatched by Ize-Iyamu Campaign Organization. Igini sued Mayaki and others. And on Christmas day, Mayaki apologized publicly via a statement. Oghenesivbe, assured that Urhobo Nation and indeed Nigerians will always be proud of Igini’s unblemished public service, especially for his patriotism and enviable contributions towards the nation’s political stability cum credible elections, adding that he is one of the few reliable and transparent INEC Commissioners in the country.

For this reason, APETRI is appealing to our brother, a proud Deltan, a detribalised Nigerian and illustrious son of Urhobo Nation, in the person of Igini to forgive his detractors in the spirit of Christmas. “Mayaki and his paymasters should know that to go against a divine mandate will always amount to unattainable desires, and therefore self-inflicted injury is unavoidable; especially conspiracy calculated to turn black to white, as can be seen from the pursuit of futility by Mayaki and his co-travellers while trying to sell a Christian cum Muslim ratified governorship candidate. “Mayaki and his partners in fake news and gross misinformation must of a necessity pick up Mike Igini’s legal bills and do the needful to further pacify him. “It is obvious that the plot to unjustly assassinate the enviable character and solid integrity of Igini failed woefully. He is a man of impeccable character and uncommon integrity,” the group affirmed. SHOCKING!
