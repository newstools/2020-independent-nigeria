He said that the polytechnic currently has 85 students due to the carrying capacity of the institution. Ukekpe said that the school could not admit more than the carrying capacity prescribed by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), noting that the admission capacity in Computer Science had been met but not in Statistics. “By next year we will be good to go for the engineering programmes. Some of the equipment have been installed.” “When I came in, there was no access road, there were no buildings that were near completion. No contractor was on site.” “We are targeting eight more courses. We have manpower on ground but it is not adequate. We will be employing if they lift the embargo by next year. What stopped the process was the embargo placed on employment at the outbreak of COVID-19.” “Eighty per cent of the projects you have seen here is as a result of TETFUND intervention. I want to thank TETFUND; we are doing our best to attract more TETFUND interventions where possible”, Ukekpe said. On the issue of cultism, the rector said there was no reported case of cultism as students have been warned against it. Ukekpe dismissed insinuations about the host community was encroaching into the institution’s land. He said that the community donated the permanent site to the polytechnic and the relationship between them was cordial. SHOCKING!
