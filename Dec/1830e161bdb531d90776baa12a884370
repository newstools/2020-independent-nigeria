Barcelona are nervously awaiting news over a potentially serious knee injury to Philippe Coutinho, which could see the Brazilian miss the next four months of action. The 28-year-old suffered the blow during La Blaugrana’s 1-1 draw with Eibar on Tuesday evening, and had to be helped from the pitch by medical staff as he headed down the tunnel. According to AS, the initial prognosis is not good news. Club doctors performed a quick assessment on Coutinho in the dressing room, and they fear that he may have suffered damage to the external meniscus of his left knee – an injury that can take up to four months to recover from.

He will now undergo an MRI scan to evaluate the extent of the damage, and if it is the case that he has suffered a complete tear, surgery will be the only option – meaning a lengthy spell out of the game. However, there is hope that he has only partially torn the meniscus, which would allow Coutinho to avoid surgery and nurse his knee back to full health. That course of action would still require six to eight weeks of rehabilitation, meaning he would not return until the middle of February – at best.

The fact that he had to be supported when leaving the field indicates a complete lack of stability in the left knee, pointing to a more serious injury than hoped. News of his absence is another blow to manager Ronald Koeman, who is still trying to figure out a way of getting the best out of his Barça side. In the latest of a long line of setbacks, his side were held to a 1-1 draw with Eibar in La Liga as Lionel Messi watched on from the sidelines; a result that leaves them in sixth place, trailing leaders Atletico Madrid by seven points.
