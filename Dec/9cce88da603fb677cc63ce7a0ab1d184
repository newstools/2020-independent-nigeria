We must recommit to loving one another even as Christ loved us and was born as man.” “Importantly, it is in our culture as Africans to be our brother’s keeper. We must never abandon the vulnerable and less privileged members of our society.” “My wife and I have, therefore, decided to continuously stick by these widows through this annual event, ensuring that they celebrate like others at Christmas,” he said. Also Sen Chimaroke Nnamani (PDP-ENUGU ) in a statement, urged Nigerians to use Christmas to pray for unity, peace and security of Nigeria.Nnamani, a former Governor of Enugu State noted that the unabating security situation; killings, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and other violent crimes should give every Nigerian a cause to worry. He acknowledged the efforts of security operatives toward curbing the menace but expressed concern that the efforts have not yielded the desired results. “What it means is that something novel or more than the ordinary should be done to meet the target.” “There must be new approaches to the security challenge including but not limited to inter agencies collaboration and cooperation as well as deployment of appropriate modern technology.” “This has become imperative and indeed urgent to give citizens hope that a solution is in the offing,” he said.
