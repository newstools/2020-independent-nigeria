The Imo House of Assembly on Tuesday amended the Imo State Administration of Criminal Justice Law No. 2 of 2020 and three other Executive Bills.The bills, which were sponsored by the Deputy Majority Leader of the house, Mr Emeka Nduka, (APC Ehime Mbano), received accelerated hearing by the house.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the amended sections included 472, 484 and 485.Section 484 of the law was deleted in the amended version.The section previously read: “where a person is ordered to be detained at the governor’s pleasure, such a person shall be liable to be detained in such place and under such conditions as the governor may direct and whilst so detained, shall be deemed to be in legal custody,’’The amendment reads: “where any person is ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to be detained at the governor’s pleasure, such a person shall be liable to be detained in such place and under such conditions as the governor may direct and whilst so detained, shall be deemed to be in legal custody.”Also, subsection Two of 485 was amended to read: “a licence under subsection One may be in such form and may contain such conditions as the court may direct”.It formerly read: “a licence under subsection One may be in such form and may contain such conditions as the governor may direct.”NAN recalls that the criminal justice law caused uproar in the state in September 2020, when it was signed by Gov. Hope Uzodimma.The sponsor of the bill at the time, Frank Ugboma (PDP Oguta), had expressed shock at what he described as “sudden obnoxious sections of the law, particularly section 484.”The house also amended the Imo State Waste Management Agency Law No. Five of 2020 and the Imo State Bureau for the Coordination of Donor Assisted Projects Establishment Law of 2020.Also amended was the Imo State Small and Medium Scale Industries Development Agency Establishment Law No. 14 of 2020.
