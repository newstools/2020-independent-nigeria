So they would be in dialogue to avoid misunderstandings.” The traditional ruler who pointed out that although his subjects didn’t buy the idea that Fulani herdsmen were coming into the com­munity, but he also made it categorically clear that the herdsmen can not be avoided because they were Nigerians and they have their rights of movements and residency in any part of the country. According to him, ” There are herdsmen that have be­come citizens either by birth or by marriage in Anambra. Those herdsmen are the ones we can harbour be­cause they have been living with us for a long time now. “Not all the herdsmen are bad. The ones that come into Anambra don’t cause problems because they know it is their place of residence. They will also in­form you when the bad ones come from Niger Republic.” Igwe Mbanefo disclosed.
