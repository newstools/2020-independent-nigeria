Ian Wright has questioned why Mikel Arteta is keeping faith in the same Arsenal players despite the club’s struggles this season. The Gunners are spending Christmas Day in 15th place in the Premier League table, and they face a tough Boxing Day all-London clash against Chelsea. Arteta is enduring some the worst form of any manager in the club’s illustrious history, but Wright says the Spaniard isn’t making life easier for himself ahead of a crunch period of matches.

After Chelsea, the Gunners face crunch away games at Brighton and West Brom which could see them move away from the danger zone, or become further embroiled in it. Wright wants Arteta to change his approach for the forthcoming matches, starting by axing some big names.

Why are you playing people like Kolasinac? Why are you playing someone like Mustafi? “I’d rather see [William] Saliba who is playing in the Under-23s, I’d rather see Smith Rowe and I’d rather see something different. “I would say to the people upstairs: give Mesut Ozil the money if you’re not going to play him and move him on. Same with Kolasinac and same with those players that are in and around the club and aren’t going to contribute. That’s what he needs, players who are contributing. Arsenal have to realise they’re in a situation that can get worse and if they do lose those games against Brighton and West Brom… those games are must-win games.” SHOCKING!
