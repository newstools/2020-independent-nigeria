The President, Alumni of Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron (AMANO), Mr. Emmanuel Maiguwa, on Monday said that lack of data and infrastructure was inhibiting growth in the nation’s ports. In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos, Maiguwa said that because of poor infrastructure, the ports appeared as if they had large volumes of trade. “According to the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) website, averagely, we could see that the entire Nigerian ports were having about one million Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEUs) of containers annually.” EXPOSED - HOW LAGOS DOCTOR DISCOVERED MAJOR REASONS WHY MOST WIVES NOW HEAVILY CHEATS ON THEIR HUSBANDS AND THE PERMANENT SECRET TO SEXUALLY SATISFYING THEIR WIVES.

Maiguwa called for adequate capture of  activities in the nation’s maritime industry  to give a true picture of the Nigerian maritime space. He noted that there were many activities in the maritime industry outside the raider of oil and gas which were not being captured in forecasts. He said  it was hard to forecast the true position of the nation’s maritime industry  at the moment. “However, we could clearly see where we are losing, as some ships destined for our ports move to neighbouring countries.” “If we have a ship that is to wait on our waters for three weeks, it is going to be three weeks of servicing that ship because the crew will need fresh vegetables, data for phone.” “The ship may decide to carry out cleaning underwater and certain maintenance,” he said. Maiguwa said that someone would handle such, adding that it would  be a complete supply chain right from the port. “If we run a system where a one-day voyage to Cotonou can provide all these things safely for a ship, the ship will not come into Nigeria;  it will rather stay in Cotonou and only come into Nigeria when it is extremely necessary, so the services move there.” “There used to be  mooring companies in Nigeria but they equally have moved to Cotonou, we are losing deploying all these services”, he said.
