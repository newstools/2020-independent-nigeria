The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) says it will investigate the scarcity of funds wit­nessed by customers in most Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in Lagos State. The CBN‘s Acting Direc­tor, Corporate Communica­tions, Mr Osita Nwanisobi, said on Wednesday, that ATMs were introduced so as to ease the suffering of the people. Nwanisobi spoke on the heels of customers com­plaining that the prolifera­tion of agent banking was responsible for ATMs not having money to dispense any more.

Meanwhile, a revealed that some ATMs that were not dispensing cash were those that were either faulty or looted and vandalised during the #EndSARS pro­tests. Those ATMs that were not faulty, but due to network issues were also not dispens­ing cash thus causing scarci­ty of funds, thereby, leaving customers to patronise agent banking. According to CBN, agent banking is “the provision of financial services to custom­ers by a third party (agent) on behalf of a licensed de­posit-taking financial insti­tution and/or mobile money operator. A visit to the Firstbank ATMs at Iganmu, showed the machines in the bank premises were not dispens­ing, but the ones in the bank­ing hall are working well. Also at Firstbank ATM in Egbe, Isolo Road, the four machines, all in good work­ing conditions, had no cash to dispense. Customers, who came into the premises, com­plained that scarcity of funds had always been the order of the day at that par­ticular First Bank quick ser­vice point. SHOCKING!
