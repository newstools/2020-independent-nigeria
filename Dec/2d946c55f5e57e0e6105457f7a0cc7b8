“Wonder Woman 1984” pulled in roughly $36.1 million at theatres worldwide over the Christmas holiday weekend, distributor Warner Bros. said on Sunday as it confirmed plans for a third film in the superhero franchise. Of that total, an estimated $16.7 million came from U.S. and Canadian theatres, the AT&T Inc-owned studio said.
