The Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution (IPCR) says engaging stakeholders regularly to discuss the causes and nature of conflicts towards peace-building is key to addressing insecurity. The Director-General, IPCR, Dr Bakut O. Bakut, said this Thursday in Abuja, in a statement following a round table discussion by stakeholders and experts organised by IPCR to address peacekeeping and state-building challenges. The recent round table discussion, he said, was geared towards addressing prevailing conflict trends and dynamics in Nigeria as part of the processes of updating the strategic conflict assessment which began in 2002.

Bakut said that IPCR was saddled with the responsibility of investigating the causes and dynamics of conflict in Nigeria and indeed Africa, and making evidence-informed recommendations to the decision makers.

He further said that the Institute had been working with stakeholders from within and outside the country to achieve the mandate of bringing peace to the country. Bakut said such stakeholders included state and non-state actors, the World Bank, agencies from foreign countries, security agencies, civil society organisations, the academia, among others, the statement added.
