A camper van parked in the US city of Nashville, Tennessee exploded early Christmas morning, injuring three people. The blast caused widespread communication outages, which also took down the police emergency systems and grounded holiday travel at the city’s airport. Law enforcement officials found human remains in the vicinity of the explosion. It isn’t clear whether the remains are of the victim or the person responsible for the explosion. Authorities say the explosion was intentional. The injured were taken to hospitals nearby and were in stable condition on Friday evening. The blast caused damage to 20 buildings, including store-fronts, badly damaged and the road surface charred — scattering glass, tree branches and bricks in an area. Police reached the scene of the blast while responding to calls that gunshots were fired before discovering the RV that was blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes.
