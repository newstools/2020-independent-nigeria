Barcelona have released a statement to confirm that star player and club captain Lionel Messi is carrying an ankle injury and is currently unavailable for selection. Blaugrana players returned to training on Sunday following a short Christmas break, but Messi was not among those in the club’s facilities with multiple reports claiming that he had been granted a prolonged Christmas break.
