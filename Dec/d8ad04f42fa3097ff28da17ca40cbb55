P/HARCOURT – Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, has said the essence of joining a political party should be to improve the well-being of the people and not for pecuni­ary benefits. The governor maintained that there is still no alternative to the Peoples Democratic Par­ty (PDP), which he said, had been working conscientiously to improve the quality of life of Rivers’ people. He stated this at the grand reception in the honour of former Director General of Tonye Cole Campaign Organ­isation, Dr Chidi Lloyd, on his return to the PDP at Elele-Ali­mini in Emohua local govern­ment area of the state.

Represented by his Chief of Staff, Chief Emeka Woke, Wike said he was excited that Lloyd, whom he described as a man of character and principle, decid­ed to return to the PDP. “Some of you who are here may not know when all of us agreed that we are standing for Rt. Hon. Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, Chidi was standing alone. He was the lone voice crying in the House of As­sembly.

He stood by Rivers people. He stood for the law and he de­fended the law passed by Riv­ers State House of Assembly.” Wike explained that the whole essence of joining po­litical party or supporting a political party, should not be for pecuniary benefit, but to improve the wellbeing of the people. The governor said when Lloyd initially joined the APC, he had erroneously assumed that it was the right thing to do at the time, until he realised the futility of joining a party that did not care about the wellbeing of his people. “He has turned back and we have to receive him be­cause we know he is a man of character, we know he is a man of integrity,” he said. Wike noted that since 2015, both the PDP and the APC had campaigned in Elele, but only the PDP had fulfilled its electioneering promises to fix all internal roads and develop human capital in Elele com­munity.
