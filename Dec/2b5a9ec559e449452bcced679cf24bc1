According to Fitch Ratings, “Coronation Merchant Bank has good asset-quality, reporting zero impaired loans (IFRS 9 Stage3)/gross ratio as at end 9M20, which has also been the case since inception. CMB’s lending has continued to grow rapidly (up 45% yoy in 9M20), in line with high demand for imports and the diversification of the bank’s funding profile.

The Bank’s business model and risk management has held firm during the past few difficult quarters and has prevented asset-quality deterioration or pressure on its funding and liquidity. The Bank’s Long and Short-term IDRs are driven by its standalone credit profile as determined by its VR, which reflects Nigeria’s (B/Stable) challenging and volatile operating environment.” Commenting on the revised outlook, Banjo Adegbohungbe, Managing Director/ CEO of Coronation Merchant Bank, stated that, “Earlier this year, we became the first Merchant Bank in Nigeria to be internationally rated. Our bold decision to proceed with an internationally accepted rating despite the challenging and uncertain operating environment was a reflection of our confidence in our franchise, our risk management culture and our commitment to delivering sustained value to our clients. The revised outlook from Fitch attests to the efficacy of our business strategy, and we will continue to build on this to deliver long term value for our clients.” Airtel Begins Initiative To Feed 5,000 IDPs Dangote Wins 2020 Best Company In Infrastructure Devt., CSR Award About Coronation Merchant Bank GTBank 728 x 90 Coronation Merchant Bank was established in 2015 to provide wholesale banking to a long-underserved market.
