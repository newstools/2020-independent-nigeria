The road serves a lot of commercial purposes, but due to paucity of funds in 2019, our scope was limited to the construction of culverts at very critical locations. “In 2019, we constructed eight culverts and cleared road from zero to 14 km. This year, we have increased the work to 15 km with four additional culverts in addition to 2.5 km surface dressing. The road has accomplished its threshold, and what was provided has been exhausted,” he said.

On direct labour, he said that a wash- out bridge on Argungu – Bui Road, was also repaired sequel to an approval granted by the Agency’s Managing Director, Nuradeen Rafin-Dadi. “The bridge has been repaired and the protective works of embankment is ongoing. We have approval to increase one kilometer surface dressing as soon as the contractors resume work in Jan. 2021,” he said. Usman, however, said that the Tuga – Ka’oje project would only commence when the agency accessed the funds approved by Rafin-Dadi, adding that the Birnin Kebbi – Argungu – Sokoto Road, which manifests potholes, would also be repaired from the funds.
