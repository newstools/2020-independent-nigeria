In fact, there is nothing more important than security today in this country. We need to work hard and of course resources will be made more available, we believe that with the kind of commitment we have so far shown in the National Assembly to work with the executive on addressing the security challenges of this country and with the commitment Mr President has also shown, I believe that at the end of the day, we will have a better security environment.” According to the senate president, the National Assembly will continue to support the president to enable him function properly as the President of the country. Lawan said: “We are here to represent our people, we are in the National Assembly to represent the national interest, it doesn’t matter where that interest is coming from or which interest it is so long as it is a national interest. “We will give Mr President the kind of support that he requires to make Nigeria a better place, to make Nigeria a safer place and to make the economy of Nigeria work for every Nigeria.” SHOCKING!
