ABAKALIKI – The Caretaker Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ebonyi State, Honourable Stanley Okoro Emegha, said the Minister of Science Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, was fully in support of the defection of Governor David Umahi to the APC. Emegha who disclosed this during an interactive chat with the members of the Correspondents’ Chapel of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), said Onu had since moved his supporters to Umahi’s camp. He said Onu’s perceived silence over the defection of Umahi to the APC as well as his absence in the events that marked the defection did not mean he was against it.

According to him, it could be that Onu was busy with other engagements when Umahi’s defection to the APC took place. “Dr Ogbonnaya Onu is with us. His supporters are all with us, now. That he has been silent or absent in our programmes since the defection of the Governor to the APC does not mean he is not with the Governor. He has moved all his supporters to us,” Emegha said.

Emegha further said the APC under his leadership in Ebonyi state, was ready to reconcile all aggrieved stakeholders, adding that Ebonyians had fully embraced the APC following the defection of the State Governor to the party. Asked why the APC is using the Akanu Ibiam International Conference Centre which is a government facility as its office, Emegha disclosed that the party rented the building from Ebonyi State government, saying they have evidence of payment.
