UMUAHIA – Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council (ONYC) World­wide has attributed the sudden collapse of Am­bassador George Obiozor at the last Imeobi meeting of Ohanaeze Ndigbo at Enugu on Sunday to the anger of the gods of Igbo land. According to the body, the incident could be a way the gods wanted to warn against undue imposition of any candidate to the Ohanaeze exalted posi­tion, adding that it was an abomination in Igbo land to impose a leadership on the people. In a statement signed by the President-General Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, and Secretary General, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, and made available to Daily Indepen­dent in Umuahia, the body insisted that it would only support a candidate that was not sponsored by any government or group.
