Leeds host relegation threatened Burnley at Elland Road this weekend, in a game that will be viewed as a must-win by both sides. Sitting 14th in the table, a win at home for Leeds over Burnley will move them on 20 points for the season – halfway to the magical ‘guaranteed survival’ points tally of 40. Marcelo Bielsa was criticised last time out for his team’s abandon to the wind approach at Old Trafford, but he is likely to stick to his guns again to get back to winning ways.

Here’s 90min’s thoughts on how Leeds should line up to get all three points. Iran Reveals COVID-19 Data For December 26 Israel To Vaccinate Over 150,000 People Per Day, Health Ministry Chief Says Illan Meslier (GK): Although didn’t have the best of games against Manchester United, he is still Bielsa’s man between the sticks. An ideal game to get his fifth clean sheet of the year.Stuart Dallas (RB): Scored the pick of the bunch at Old Trafford, sailing a gorgeous shot past David de Gea. Bielsa’s most reliable defender this year by quite a distance.Luke Ayling (CB): Put in a horrid performance against Man Utd but due to injuries, is guaranteed a starting role. Needs to step up.Diego Llorente (CB): With captain Liam Cooper likely to miss out due to an abdominal strain, the £18m summer signing from Real Sociedad will be asked to deputise. Would be only his second start for the Yorkshire club.Ezgjan Alioski (LB): The Macedonian scored in his last game at home, but needs improve defensively. Kalvin Phillips (DM): Was run off the park by Man United‘s midfield last week and will be expected to put in a much better performance this weekend.Raphinha (RM): A real live wire on his day. Got both assists last week and has really impressed in recent weeks. The Brazilian is one of the first names on the teamsheet.Rodrigo (CM): The Spaniard is being asked to play a deeper role than he is perhaps used to, but is performing well regardless.Mateusz Klich (CM): Subbed off at halftime last time out, saving himself any more humiliation. Picked up a knock, but should be fit to start.Jack Harrison (LM): Missed a good chance to score at Old Trafford but can be counted on to perform. A shoo-in to start. Patrick Bamford (ST): Continues to prove all his doubters wrong, with eight goals in 14 league games this season. This is a prime game to reach double figures and to make Southgate really think hard about his Euros forward line. SHOCKING!
