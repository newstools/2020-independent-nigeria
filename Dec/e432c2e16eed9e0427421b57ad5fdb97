The Gombe State Government, on Thursday, donated 36 water pumps to dry season farmers in the state to improve their livelihoods, particularly those in rural communities. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that besides the water pumps, 26 motorcycles, six Hilux vehicles and one Toyota Hiace Bus were distributed under a partnership between the state government and the AfDB supported Inclusive Basic Services Delivery and Livelihood Empowerment Integrated Project (IBSDLEIP) which is targeting women, youths and the vulnerable. At the launch of the distribution of the machines, Governor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe said it was part of government’s effort to boost food security, in addition to re-integrating farmers into the system having been neglected since the state signed the IBSDLEIP in 2016.

If our youths are not engaged, they may indulge in activities that can impede development in the state,” he said. 2020 Most Challenging Year, Oyetola New Year Message: President Buhari To Address Nigerians On Friday Commissioner for Water Resources, Alhaji Mijinyawa Yahaya, said that vehicles and motorcycles would also be distributed for effective supervision of the implementation of IBSDLEIP .
