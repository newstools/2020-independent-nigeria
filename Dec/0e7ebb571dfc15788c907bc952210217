The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said it would deepen enlightenment campaigns among motorists and commuters on COVID-19 protocols as fear of second wave of the pandemic heightens in the country. The Corps said it would increase its activities on the highways as yuletide seasons approaches. Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, Corps Marshal of the Corps, who spoke in Lagos at the one day capacity training and workshop for Nigeria Automobile Journalists of Nigeria (NAJA), declared that the corps would be unrelenting in its commitment to safer road environment through sustained campaigns, even as the end of year special patrols begins.

Oyeyemi represented by Mr. Bisi Kazeem, Assistant Corps Marshall and Public Enlightenment Officer, FRSC, assured that his officers would deepen campaigns on social distancing by travellers and motorists to curb the spread of the second wave of Covid-19.

He noted the outcome of the workshop would contribute immediately to the attainment of the goals of well-trained auto journalists who he said were capable of delivering on the professional competence of reporting the dynamics of automobile industry.
