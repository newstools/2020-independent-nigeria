ABUJA – The upper chamber of the National Assembly has exposed how officials of the Ministry of Defence paid N968.8 million for the production and supply of medals and ribbons for Independence anniver­sary for the armed forces without approval from the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and the Ministerial Tenders Board. In a report by the Audi­tor General of the Feder­ation, the officials of the Ministry of Defence were said to have facilitated payment for the contract despite the objection raised by the Deputy Director (Budget) in a memo dated April 24, 2013. To this end, the Senate Committee on Public Ac­count, chaired by Senator Matthew Urhoghide, sus­tained the indictment re­port against the Ministry of Defence over the issue due to the failure of offi­cials of the ministry to ex­plain their own side of the allegation.
