Crystal Palace – Leicester: Harvey Barnes’ late goal salvaged a point for a weakened Leicester City lineup in a 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace on Monday at Selhurst Park. Wilfried Zaha’s wonderful goal before the hour mark could’ve been enough to produce a first win in five tries for Palace. Instead, the Eagles have three draws and two losses in that stretch. Palace’s 19th point takes it above Newcastle and into 13th, while Leicester moved ahead of Everton into second where it will stay for the day since the Toffees’ match with Man City was postponed due to the visitors’ many positive COVID-19 tests.
