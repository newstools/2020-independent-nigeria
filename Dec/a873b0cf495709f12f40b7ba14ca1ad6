Abuja- The recent call by former Bayelsa State governor, Senator Seriake Dickson, for the scrapping of the office of the sole administrator for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has come under sharp criticism by a forum of professionals from the region under the auspices of the South-South Emerging Leaders Forum (SELF) The group in a statement on Monday said the scrapping of the interim management committee of the NDDC and the appointment of Effiong Akwa as Sole Administrator by President Muhammadu Buhari, was done in line with the Act setting up the Commission. In the statement, SELF National Coordinator, Barrister Preye Johnson, revealed that a critical analysis of the development shows that those against the recent appointment were doing so for their personal gains.

He also stated that the appointment of a Sole Administrator for the Commission absolves the minister of Niger Delta Affairs of any wrongdoing.

It will be recalled that in 2015, the Minister of Transport, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi appointed Mrs. Ibim Semenitari, an Ijaw woman and his former aide as a Sole Administrator of NDDC after sacking the Dan Abia-led management of the Commission.” “Our appeal to the entire people of the Niger Delta is to support the new leadership of the NDDC to deliver on its mandate and supervise to completion the ongoing forensic audit ordered by the Federal Government.” The forum said it will not tolerate any form of character assassination of the Minister of Niger Delta by any group or individuals, adding that “People should come to the equity with a clean hands. “Senator Akpabio’s antecedents are there for anyone to see. As a governor of Akwa Ibom state, Akpabio developed and left a legacy no one has been able to reach. We believe that this Minister means well for our region and no one or group should distract him from delivering on his mandate,” the forum stated. SHOCKING!
