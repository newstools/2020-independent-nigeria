From bans on Concerts, Cinemas and other social gatherings to the constraints of digital sales, I will say the Nigeria entertainment has suffered a great deal”, he said. Speaking further, he noted that though the pandemic has been draining, some entertainers still found a way to make the best out of it. “Some creators made the most of it, while others are either still getting their heads wrapped around the new normal or actually trying out new tricks to beat the constraints the pandemic brought with it.” He noted that the industry may never recover from the pangs of the pandemic. “I don’t believe that the world would return 100% to the old form of doing to things. New methods and strategies are already been used to achieve desired results. I always encourage entertainers that I consult for to embrace the new normal and open their minds to a different approach to achieving results.” SHOCKING!
