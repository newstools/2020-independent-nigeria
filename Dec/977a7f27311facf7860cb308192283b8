Borussia Mönchengladbach striker Marcus Thuram has been banned for five games for spitting in the face of a Hoffenheim opponent in the Bundesliga. The German football federation said the ban applies to both league games and the German Cup and that a further one-game ban is suspended on condition of good behaviour until December 21, 2021. Thuram, who was also fined €40,000, spat in defender Stefan Posch’s face from close range on Saturday during an argument over a tackle from Posch. The referee consulted video evidence, sent off Thuram and booked Posch.
