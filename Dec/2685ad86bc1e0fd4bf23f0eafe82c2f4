Goals from Bertrand Traore, Kortney Hause and Anwar El Ghazi were enough to earn a third win in four Premier League matches for Dean Smithâ€™s team, who had Tyrone Mings sent-off just before half-time. Traore opened the scoring inside five minutes before Mings was dismissed after picking up two bookings in quick succession. But Villa remained in control of the match and ran out comfortable winners as Hause and El Ghazi struck in the second half. SHOCKING!
