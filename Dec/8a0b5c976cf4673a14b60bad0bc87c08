LAGOS  – The Lagos chapter of the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors has tasked the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation (OSGoF), Surveyors Registration Council of Nigeria (SURCON) and its national body in Abuja to constitute a committee whose responsibility will be to look at the possible amendment of the SURCON law as it exists today. This position was made known during the chapter’s 35th Annual General Meeting (AGM) and luncheon which took place recently at the Anchor Events Centre, Agidingbi in Lagos with the theme: The Surveying Profession in Nigeria: Past, Present and Future. According to Prof Francis Fajemirokun, who was the guest speaker at the event, there is no reason why they cannot have a revised law passed by the National Assembly to take care of the shortcomings of the existing law.

Citing an instance, the former UNILAG Deputy Vice Chancellor revealed that despite the life of the 7th Council expiring since August that the Council was still in place. “There is a lacuna in place again, though by our consent, the court seem to say that is not so! It is not right! The NIS, OSGOF and SURCON should constitute a committee to look at the possible amendments to the SURCON law. Our lack of unity has negatively affected the profession, and we must unite now.

But we have made some suggestions. The key to success, which will drive all other inputs for success, is the settlement of the differences between surveyors in government and those in the private sector. The division must stop and we must henceforth see one another as partners in progress.” Fajemirokun disclosed that over time, the practice has been modernised even though there were still areas for improvement such as in synergy, having a wrong sense of purpose; having to trust one another; having to be truthful; having to be humble and having respect for one another. Government, he advised, must recognise that the survey data is the most important aspect of development. While x-raying the profession over time, Adeleke Adesina, Lagos NIS chairman narrated that technological development has made the practice much easier than it used to, that with the GPS, one can set ones instrument anywhere, connect it to the satellite and get the coordinate of a particular point in real time. He also hinted that they were not sleeping on their oars as they were making frantic efforts to ensure their members were in tune with current realities as it relates with their professional practice. “That was why the MCPD is being organised yearly to keep our members abreast of new technological developments that will equip them for future surveying.” SHOCKING!
