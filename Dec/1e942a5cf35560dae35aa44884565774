ABUJA – Secretary to the Govern­ment of the Federation and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Musta­pha, has decried the rate of infections of COVID-19, in­sisting that 16 out of every 100 persons who get tested turn out positive. He said week 52 since the pandemic broke out in Ni­geria has shown the high­est number of infections in a single week. The PTF chairman gave the information on Tues­day, while giving daily up­date of the infection and control measures.

DON'T BE A VICTIM! “Our national response is passing through a chal­lenging phase due to the seriousness of the second wave of infections in Nige­ria. Week 52 has so far giv­en us the highest number of infections, in a single week, to date. “Our TPR analysis shows that 16 out of every 100 tests carried out are positive. We are also see­ing increasing transmis­sion among younger people and this is not considered good and safe. We must, therefore, exercise utmost restraint by taking respon­sibility”.

He said the measure was in keeping with determina­tion to minimise any pos­sibility of importation of the virus. He said the new policy started from Monday, 28th December, 2020 and would henceforth require permit to travel/QR code obtained from the travel portal after payment for the day seven post-arrival test; including a COVID-19 PCR negative test with a validity now shortened to 96 hours or 4 days. “The PTF shall remain vigilant on this matter and our relevant agencies are also working on the se­quencing to determine the strain found. “With effect from 1st January, 2021 the passports of the first 100 passengers that failed to take their day seven post-arrival PCR test will be published in the national dailies. The pass­ports, as a deterrent, will also be suspended till June 2021”. He said the PTF, dis­cussed two very critical issues, namely oxygen supply and case manage­ment. With the increasing number of infections and hospitalisation, the objec­tives was to: ensure that infection, prevention and control (IPC) is properly instituted to minimise spread and exposure of health care workers to the virus; ensure that those who require hospitalisa­tion are well managed; those requiring medical at­tention for other ailments gain access to treatment at medical facilities; and crit­ical care is available and deployed especially where oxygen is needed. The sit­uation in Abuja and envi­rons have been of concern to the PTF. “During our conversa­tion with health authori­ties (including the CMDs of federal tertiary insti­tutions in Abuja, National Hospital, Jabi & Gwagwala­da) this afternoon, the PTF directed that the level of infections, prevention and control as well as case management should be prioritised immediately,” he stated.
