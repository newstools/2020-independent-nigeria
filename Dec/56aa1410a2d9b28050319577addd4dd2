LAGOS – A Niger Delta-based human rights group, Centre for Human Rights and Anti-Corruption (CHURAC), has threatened to challenge the recent appoint­ment of a Sole Administrator for the Niger Delta Develop­ment Commission (NDDC) in court. Alaowei E. Cleric, CHURAC National President, in a state­ment issued on Wednesday, de­scribed the appointment of Sole Administrator to manage the affairs of the NDDC as unlaw­ful and should not be allowed. He stated that there was no­where in the NDDC Establish­ment Act that provided for the position of Sole Administrator, stressing that such action was illegal, describing it as a gate­way to continue the sleaze in the commission.

Godswill Ak­pabio, the minister of the Niger Delta, should not turn NDDC to his personal property. We will not watch akimbo and allow some corrupt minds to pilfer away our common patrimony.” According to him, “The on­going forensic audit is anoth­er scam. It has only provided a platform for looting of the commission’s scarce resourc­es. What made Sen. Akpabio to think that the forensic auditors cannot do the work under a sub­stantive board?” Buhari Greets Judith Amaechi At 50 Three Killed, 33 Others Injured In Accident In Niger Cleric called on President Muhammadu Buhari not to allow his office to be manipu­lated by those he termed pen robbers, stressing that his ac­tions and inactions towards the NDDC crisis amounted to trading with the peace in the Niger Delta. “Mr. President should im­mediately disband that illegal and unlawful Sole Administra­tor and appoint a substantive board in line with the commis­sion’s enabling Act.” SHOCKING!
