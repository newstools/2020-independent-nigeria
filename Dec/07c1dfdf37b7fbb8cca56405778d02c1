UGHELLI – A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Chairmanship aspirant in Burutu Local Government Area of Delta State, Honourable Godwin Masah, has called on Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and the State PDP Chairman, Olorogun Kingsley Esiso, to call to order some leaders who are trying to hand-twist the unwritten zoning arrangement between the North and South of the council area in respect of the chairmanship seat. In a signed statement, Hon Masah said the date for the chairmanship primary election has come and gone with no PDP primaries conducted anywhere but regrettably some persons led by the PDP local government area party chairman, Mr Ebike Oromoni, in connivance with some top government functionaries and leaders are claiming to have returned the incumbent, Hon. Godknows Angele against several concerns and protest to the Governor and the State PDP chairman, Barr. Kingsley Esiso. He explained in the statement that some persons are trying to push down Hon. Angele down the throats of the Burutu North people to return to office for a second time irrespective of several protest and complaints.

He noted in the statement that in the past when Chief Ebikeme Clark wanted to return for second term, he was gently turned down by His Excellency the Governor under the guise that the Burutu people have said there was a power rotational principle between the North and South. He questioned why the case of Hon. Angele of the south divide of Burutu LGA is different. “Angele should be told the plain truth to back out. I know some persons outside Burutu are using the Governor’s name to try and hand twist the Burutu North people who have contributed immensely in terms of votes returned during the first and second elections of the Governor”.
