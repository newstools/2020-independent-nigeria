ABAKALIKI – The Caretaker Chair­man of the All Progressives Con­gress (APC) in Eb­onyi State, Stanley Okoro Emegha, has said the Min­ister of Science Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, was in support of the defection of Governor David Umahi to the APC. Emegha, who disclosed this during an interactive chat with the members of the Correspondents’ Chapel of Nigeria Union of Jour­nalists (NUJ), said Onu had since moved his supporters to Umahi’s camp. He said Onu’s perceived silence over the defection of Umahi to the APC as well as his absence at the events that marked the defection did not mean he was against it.

According to him, it could be that Onu was busy with other engagements when Umahi’s defection to the APC took place. “Dr Ogbonnaya Onu is with us. His supporters are all with us now. That he has been silent or absent at our programmes since the defec­tion of the Governor to the APC does not mean he is not with the Governor. He has moved all his supporters to us,” Emegha said.
